@58731 = ~We did nothing wrong!~
@58732 = ~You were creating a disturbance.~
@58733 = ~We've lost everything! We were frustrated. You would be too.~
@58734 = ~You were shouting and fighting amongst yourselves.~
@58735 = ~We raised our voices and one of us shoved another, that's all!~
@58736 = ~It's enough. Now still your tongue till you see the magistrate.~
@58737 = ~What will happen to us?~
@58738 = ~This is outrageous! We haven't done anything wrong!~
@58739 = ~You lot just sit tight until backup arrives.~
@58740 = ~You require assistance? What's going on here, officer?~
@58741 = ~Caught some ne'er-do-wells, did you?~
@58742 = ~You seem to have the situation in hand. I'll leave you to it.~
@58743 = ~These refugees came to our city for aid, then repaid our generosity by causing a commotion in the street.~
@58744 = ~Maybe—MAYBE we got a little rough with each other. What of it? Our tempers are short and the hours pass slowly.~
@58745 = ~If you created a disturbance, the Flaming Fist is obligated to detain you.~
@58746 = ~I feel for you, friend. The Fist enjoy harrassing honest people for any little thing.~
@58747 = ~You think you're the only ones struggling right now? You should count yourself lucky you've not tasted Flaming Fist steel this <DAYNIGHTALL>.~
@58748 = ~Thank you, hero. Yes, I recognize you. Would you be willing to do us a favor?~
@58749 = ~You think I enjoy this, do you? Think again. But these people were making trouble, the city has laws against that sort of thing, and I've a duty to enforce them. And I could use a little help.~
@58750 = ~I haven't enough people to escort all these rowdies to headquarters. Could you go to the Flaming Fist command center and tell Jenks that Officer Vida needs reinforcements?~
@58751 = ~Of course. I am always happy to assist the city's defenders.~
@58752 = ~Could, but won't.~
@58753 = ~Tell me you don't seriously expect the hero of Baldur's Gate to play messenger for you.~
@58754 = ~Please, ask the Fist to show us mercy! We've lost our homes, our possessions, some of us our families to the crusade. Must we lose our freedom too?~
@58755 = ~Perhaps you'll appreciate freedom a little more after you've spent a few days behind bars. Now still your redblooding tongues before I still them for you!~
@58756 = ~All right, I can handle it. Have a good <DAYNIGHTALL>.~
@58757 = ~We're pretty busy here. Unless there's something you need, move it along.~
@58758 = ~I have a message for an Officer Jenks from someone named Vida.~
@58759 = ~Goodbye, then.~
@58760 = ~I'm Jenks. What's going on?~
@58761 = ~A group of refugees causing a disturbance have been detained outside Sorcerous Sundries. She needs reinforcements.~
@58762 = ~I have some business to attend to. I'll give you the message later.~
@58763 = ~As long it's not urgent.~
@58764 = ~With everyone coming into the city, it's hard for us to respond to every incident. I'll get help to her as soon as I'm able. Is there anything else?~
@58765 = ~The refugees were frustrated over their losses and the crowding in the streets. They meant no harm. I hope you'll show them leniency.~
@58766 = ~These refugees were spreading chaos in the streets. You need to send a message that this behavior won't be tolerated.~
@58767 = ~That's all for now.~
@58768 = ~We need to enforce law, but we don't want to be unjust. We'll hold them the night to let them cool off. Let Vida know reinforcements will arrive as soon as possible.~
@58769 = ~I'm with you. If the refugees to start fighting in the streets, we could lose control of the city. I'll see that they receive a strict sentence.~
@58770 = ~Talk to my commander. There's nothing I can do about it. Also, don't talk to my commander, she's enough problems right now.~
@58771 = ~Please let Officer Vida know that reinforcements will arrive as soon as possible.~
@58772 = ~Goodbye.~
@58773 = ~We don't deserve this treatment.~
@58774 = ~What news, <PRO_SIRMAAM>?~
@58775 = ~Officer Jenks will send reinforcements as soon as he can.~
@58776 = ~Nothing yet.~
@58777 = ~Let me know if that changes.~
@58778 = ~Praise Helm for that. I'll bide here until they arrive.~
@58779 = ~I thought about what Tanorm had to say, and he's right. We must have compassion for the refugees. I talked to Jenks. He'll keep them overnight to cool off, no longer.~
@58780 = ~I thought about what you said earlier, Vida. And I agree—we need to quash this behavior before it spreads. Jenks will try to make an example of these refugees.~
@58781 = ~Good luck, officer.~
@58782 = ~Thank you! Having someone like you on our side means a lot. I don't have much left in this world, but please, take this as a show of my—of OUR appreciation.~
@58783 = ~I hope you know what you're doing. Goodbye.~
@58784 = ~I'm glad you understand. It's a big help to the Fist to know you're here to help out. Please, take this small token of appreciation.~
@58785 = ~Shame! Is this what passes for justice in Baldur's Gate? We should have taken our chances with the crusade. Go on, then, be on your way. Makes me sick to look on you.~
@58786 = ~Thank you again.~
@58787 = ~Good <DAYNIGHTALL>, hero.~
@58788 = ~Still we wait.~
@58789 = ~The Trial

I should continue to investigate Corinth's actions, then return to Leopas when I have the truth.

I had a talk with the ranger Corinth, who is accused by the crusader Valis of betraying them in the hamlet of Innisfall. For one who was so quick to protest his innocence, he seemed very reluctant to speak to me.~
@58790 = ~The Trial

I should continue to investigate Corinth's actions, then return to Leopas when I have the truth.

The ranger Corinth alerted the hamlet of Innisfall, costing the crusade recruits and supplies. His commander, Leopas, waits for me to declare Corinth innocent or guilty. This could get tricky...~
@58791 = ~I envy you, Ensler. I truly do. You have so much to learn. Speak to some of the others in the camp. Learn what you can from your fellows in arms.~ [BD58791]
@58792 = ~Sweet bugger all.~
@58793 = ~And you can't go about official crusade business without teeth. Give me the report.~
@58794 = ~I can see you'll not be swayed by anything I might say but for what it's worth, you're making a mistake. Luck to you.~
@58795 = ~There are times fists can be more persuasive than words.~
@58796 = ~We're in the middle of a crusade camp. This isn't one of those times.~ [BD58796]
@58797 = ~Men. You never listen.~ [BD58797]
@58798 = ~Yeah, that's my question too.~
@58799 = ~I am in hurry, sir. I need the morning report.~
@58800 = ~Just a fellow servant of Caelar. I'm searching for a stone shard about so big.~
@58801 = ~Ah, the new recruit returns. Is there something you require?~
@58802 = ~Do I look new to you?~
@58803 = ~I want to discuss what I have learned about our cause.~
@58804 = ~No, not at the moment. I will return to my duties.~
@58805 = ~I've a number of reports here requiring your personal seal, sir.~
@58806 = ~Understanding the Crusade~
@58807 = ~Understanding the Crusade

I can speak to the crusaders around camp to learn more about the crusade.

Morale Officer Deneld has asked me to speak to some of the crusaders in camp, then return to him and demonstrate my knowledge. This might be a good chance to get into the heads of my enemies.~
@58808 = ~Understanding the Crusade

I've answered Deneld's questions to his satisfaction.

Morale Officer Deneld was pleased with my understanding of the crusade and its motivations. I feel I've gained a better understanding of my enemies.~
@58809 = ~Understanding the Crusade

After I talk to a few people around camp regarding the crusade, I can return to Morale Officer Deneld.

At first, Ravoc seemed a violent warrior interested in naught but slaughter. But as I spoke to him, I realized he has personal reasons for following Caelar. Members of his tribe were killed by devils, their souls trapped in the Nine Hells. He seeks to free them.~
@58810 = ~Understanding the Crusade

After I talk to a few people around camp regarding the crusade, I can return to Morale Officer Deneld.

I spoke to a cleric of Shevarash named Sindret. A hunter of drow, as dictated by her deity, she originally joined the crusade to learn new tactics. Caelar's faith inspired her, though. Now she fights wholeheartedly for the Shining Lady's cause. It's interesting that people of such different faiths all take Caelar as a spiritual leader.~
@58811 = ~Understanding the Crusade

After I talk to a few people around camp regarding the crusade, I can return to Morale Officer Deneld.

I spoke to new recruit named Zare. He's utterly committed to Caelar, willing to do anything and everything she asks. I begin to understand how he, and others, are willing to follow Caelar into the Hells themselves.~
@58812 = ~Eh. I don't see the appeal myself.~ [BD58812]
@58813 = ~Yes. "Even" an orc.~
@58814 = ~You said they're in a chest. How am I supposed to recognize it?~
@58815 = ~Or kill us. Then someone else would have to face it, so that's good.~ [BD58815]
@58816 = ~The monster will fall.~
@58817 = ~It is. You have a problem with that?~
@58818 = ~But we will hurt you if you give us a reason.~
@58819 = ~Give us a reason. Please.~
@58820 = ~It's n-no use. We might as well be t-talking to a wall.~
@58821 = ~An understandably enraged wall, at that.~ [BD58821]
@58822 = ~Understanding the Crusade

After I talk to a few people around camp regarding the crusade, I can return to Morale Officer Deneld.

I spoke to Tristian, a cleric of the Red Knight. Conscripted by force when the crusade went through his village, he now seems happy to serve Caelar. He believes the Red Knight set him on Caelar's path, as the crusade needs planners and strategic minds.~
@58823 = ~Your faith in the Red Knight is weak. I suspected as much.~
@58824 = ~The Red Knight? She taught you nothing, fool. Whatever lesson you take from this came from our hand, no other's.~
@58825 = ~Zare~
@58826 = ~Tristian~
@58827 = ~You don't recognize crusade livery when you see it?~
@58828 = ~No, but as you can see I wear Caelar's colors. I am one of you.~
@58829 = ~Be on your way, then.~
@58830 = ~I wear crusade colors, do I not?~
@58831 = ~I recognize your uniform, but not your face. You'd not be the first of our foes to attempt to enter the castle in the guise of the faithful.~
@58832 = ~Taking risks isn't always a bad thing, Skie, but you have to know what you're risking. The crusaders are dangerous. We need to keep you safe.~ [BD58832]
@58833 = ~You handled that well, <CHARNAME>. I feared you'd be much harsher with her.~
@58834 = ~Perhaps I should have been. Skie needs to learn this isn't a game.~
@58835 = ~I wanted to be. Believe me, I wanted to. But someone's got to keep the girl safe.~
@58836 = ~I just want her out of my way. We need to get on with our mission.~
@58837 = ~There are some things a girl needs to learn on her own. Skie might have learned a lesson if faced with the consequences of her actions—but she'd probably be dead too.~ [BD58837]
@58838 = ~You sound like you're speaking from experience.~
@58839 = ~You say that like it's a bad thing.~
@58840 = ~Enough talk. We need to focus on our mission.~
@58841 = ~Heh. My father let me fall down a lot. At the time, it made me angry. I thought I'd never forgive him. Then I realized how hard it was for him to let me struggle—and fail—on my own. It made me the woman I am.~ [BD58841]
@58842 = ~A woman I'm very, very glad to know.~
@58843 = ~Grand Duke Silvershield seems unwilling to give Skie the same opportunities. I hope she finds her own path regardless. In any event, it's time we got on with our mission.~
@58844 = ~I'm more than happy to let Skie fall down, but we have more important matters to attend to right now.~
@58845 = ~We should get going.~
@58846 = ~Right. Let's go.~ [BD58846]
@58847 = ~Flatterer. I'm glad to know you too. Now let's get going.~ [BD58847]
@58848 = ~My toes itch, Boo. How much longer must I wait before we find a nice evil face worthy of kicking, do you think?~ [BD58848]
@58849 = ~There's no shortfall of faces deserving a good kick in this world. We're bound to come across one sooner than later.~ [BD58849]
@58850 = ~And then Minsc does what he does best!~ [BD58850]
@58851 = ~Ramble nonsensically to his pet rodent about other peoples' rears?~ [BD58851]
@58852 = ~And then Minsc will do what he does second best!~ [BD58852]
@58853 = ~Tell me, Captain Corwin—what is thine opinion of our friend, the hero of Baldur's Gate?~ [BD58853]
@58854 = ~Hadn't given it much thought. Having a famous hero around is handy, but it also seems to attract trouble.~ [BD58854]
@58855 = ~Or create it.~ [BD58855]
@58856 = ~Such people always invite hassles. You don't get called "hero" without someone trying to pull you down.~ [BD58856]
@58857 = ~Yet thou wouldst support our group and keep our companion standing in the face of those who wish us ill?~ [BD58857]
@58858 = ~That's my assignment, so yeah. Why do you ask?~ [BD58858]
@58859 = ~I just wanted to know where thou stood, should worse come to worst. And now I do.~ [BD58859]
@58860 = ~May I have a word, Captain Corwin?~ [BD58860]
@58861 = ~No. You can have five.~ [BD58861]
@58862 = ~I am sorry, I do not—that is six right there, eleven now... I am sorry.~ [BD58862]
@58863 = ~I though monks were supposed to be serene... It was a joke, Rasaad. What can I do for you?~ [BD58863]
@58864 = ~I was wondering if you had heard of any unusual disappearances of late. In Baldur's Gate, or elsewhere.~ [BD58864]
@58865 = ~As opposed to the USUAL disappearances.~ [BD58865]
@58866 = ~Before I left the city, several of my sect disappeared. More than can be explained by coincidence. I fear the followers of Selûne have been targeted.~ [BD58866]
@58867 = ~Now that you mention it, I did hear a couple Selûnites went missing. One was seen struggling with several robed figures, as I recall...~ [BD58867]
@58868 = ~The Fist started investigating, but with the iron crisis and now Caelar, we're spread pretty thin. I don't know what came of it, if anything.~ [BD58868]
@58869 = ~Thank you for this information. Believe me when I say it is much appreciated.~ [BD58869]
@58870 = ~So tell me, Captain—how did someone like you rise so high in the Flaming Fist?~ [BD58870]
@58871 = ~That depends what you mean by someone like me.~ [BD58871]
@58872 = ~There aren't many mothers who'd rather fight zealots thousands of miles from home when they could be making their children dinner and putting them to bed.~ [BD58872]
@58873 = ~Circumstances don't allow many people, mothers or otherwise, to do what they'd prefer.~ [BD58873]
@58874 = ~Nonsense. I do what I will, where I will, when I will, with whom I will.~ [BD58874]
@58875 = ~Keep flapping your lips and I'll show you a pathetic creature, you little tart.~ [BD58875]
@58876 = ~Captain Corwin, please! I meant no disrespect...~ [BD58876]
@58877 = ~I know what you meant. Next time keep that thrice-damned pit of hell you call a mouth shut or I'll shut it for you.~ [BD58877]
@58878 = ~What are you playing at here, drow?~ [BD58878]
@58879 = ~I'm sorry?~ [BD58879]
@58880 = ~I found it unfortunate the Council of Four thought it necessary to recruit people like yourself and the duergar to this effort. Unfortunate, but understandable. I found it strange that <CHARNAME> would welcome a drow to walk beside us. Then I learned what you were capable of and it didn't seem so strange anymore.~
@58881 = ~I can't figure you out. What's the draw? What do you hope to gain from helping in this effort?~ [BD58881]
@58882 = ~Is it so hard to believe I might seek outcasts like myself, looking for companionship or even... support?~ [BD58882]
@58883 = ~It's very hard to believe. And that little speech doesn't make me believe it any more.~ [BD58883]
@58884 = ~You are a clever woman. I begin to see why our friend <CHARNAME> tolerates you.~ [BD58884]
@58885 = ~I do not understand, <CHARNAME>. The camp is safe. Why do we not stay within it?~ [BD58885]
@58886 = ~You've spoken of nothing but paying Caelar back since we left Coast Way Crossing.~ [BD58886]
@58887 = ~The shining harlot owes me a debt, it is true—but I plan to collect with two score Flaming Fist mercenaries at my side, not a handful of chimps.~ [BD58887]
@58888 = ~The Fist has better things to do than watch a Thayan braggart's back. You don't like the chimps, feel free to leave.~ [BD58888]
@58889 = ~Don't think I'm not tempted, you loathsome scapegrace! (Control, Odesseiron, control. The wench may yet prove useful...)~ [BD58889]
@58890 = ~I can hear you, you know. We all can.~ [BD58890]
@58891 = ~She's right. Think you're talking to yourself. You're talking to everyone.~ [BD58891]
@58892 = ~Shut your mouth! I'll not hear this baseless slander. (Calm yourself, Edwin. Ignore the monkeys; do not let them drag you down to their level.)~ [BD58892]
@58893 = ~Yes, by all means, ignore us.~ [BD58893]
@58894 = ~Most do.~ [BD58894]
@58895 = ~Well, what is this? The incorruptible Captain Corwin considers me a credible candidate for conversation?~ [BD58895]
@58896 = ~I did for a second. Then you spoke, and I reconsidered.~ [BD58896]
@58897 = ~Predictable. A preponderance of people do.~ [BD58897]
@58898 = ~Flaming Fist?~ [BD58898]
@58899 = ~I'm a captain of the Flaming Fist, if that's what you're asking.~ [BD58899]
@58900 = ~Fist killed my brother. And my cousin. And my other brother. And my uncle. And two of my other brothers.~ [BD58900]
@58901 = ~I'm sorry for your loss.~ [BD58901]
@58902 = ~Didn't like most of 'em. One of my cousins was all right. Didn't know him that well. Got a spear shoved through his face.~ [BD58902]
@58903 = ~You're not like any goblin I've ever encountered, you know that?~ [BD58903]
@58904 = ~You're not like any Flaming Fist I've met. Haven't tried to kill me. Yet.~ [BD58904]
@58905 = ~I'll take that as a compliment.~
@58906 = ~I would.~
@58907 = ~Ohhh, when you live for adventure,
You're never far from life.
When you're a slave who's indentured,
You'd better find a knife.
But if you long for a normal existence
And pursue it with dogged persistence,
You'll find that a normal life's,
The eeeasiest thing of alllllll...~ [BD58907]
@58908 = ~Yeah! I could've been a bard. I just never wanted to.~ [BD58908]
@58909 = ~Do you ever get tired, gnome?~ [BD58909]
@58910 = ~Never! Maybe. Tired of what?~ [BD58910]
@58911 = ~Being so... enthusiastic.~ [BD58911]
@58912 = ~Nah. It's like my mum always says: "Baravar's cloak, son, you're driving me mad. Stop bouncing your leg like that or I'll cut it off."~ [BD58912]
@58913 = ~Your mother's a very wise woman.~ [BD58913]
@58914 = ~Who said she was a woman? Just joking. Of course she's a woman. What else would a mum be? Other than dead. But then she wouldn't be always saying things like she does. Actually, that wouldn't be so bad, now that I think of it. Maybe I should... No. No, best leave well enough alone, don't you agree?~
@58915 = ~I'm going to stop talking to you now. And I'm especially going to stop listening.~ [BD58915]
@58916 = ~You do what you've gotta do, Cap'n. You'll get no argument from me.~ [BD58916]
@58917 = ~I could not live as you live, Captain Corwin. Always in the city, away from the green... Such a life would be unbearable.~
@58918 = ~Rohma makes it bearable. Trees and grass are fine, but she's what I really have trouble being away from.~ [BD58918]
@58919 = ~It was not always easy for Khalid and I to maintain our bond while we traveled, but we found our ways.~
@58920 = ~In-indeed. Though often s-separated, we always felt cl-close.~
@58921 = ~I hope Rohma knows my heart is always with her. But she's still a child. I worry.~ [BD58921]
@58922 = ~You're a f-fine fighter, C-captain Corwin.~ [BD58922]
@58923 = ~That's high praise, coming from someone who knows his way around a sword as well as you.~ [BD58923]
@58924 = ~I trained with the city militia back in C-calimport—dedicated warriors, all. Fighting for one's city inspires much d-devotion and courage.~ [BD58924]
@58925 = ~A city's just a bunch of buildings. It's ideals that inspire people. Principles. That's why the crusade's going to be so much trouble.~ [BD58925]
@58926 = ~I see. I, uh, I'll—I'll just leave you to your th-thoughts, then.~ [BD58926]
@58927 = ~Do you actually care about anything we're trying to accomplish here?~ [BD58927]
@58928 = ~I care about what I'M trying to accomplish. I care about the vengeance I will wreak on those who dared imprison me.~ [BD58928]
@58929 = ~But not about stopping the crusade? Or the damage they could do—have done—to the Sword Coast?~ [BD58929]
@58930 = ~Your woefully narrow perspective does you no credit, Captain.~ [BD58930]
@58931 = ~No. Then you would applaud the bold actions taken to stabilize the region under the auspices of a benevolent master—your master. Now ask this: Of the two of us, whose motives are more justified? You, who arbitrarily elevate one scheming aristocrat's agenda over another's, or myself, who seeks redress for a wrong done to his own person?~ [BD58931]
@58932 = ~Rationalize your selfishness and greed however you want, half-orc. In this instance, my cause is just. I fight for a higher ideal.~ [BD58932]
@58933 = ~You fight for money, Captain. That's what mercenaries do. Before you accuse me of rationalizing my actions, you would do well to examine your own.~ [BD58933]
@58934 = ~Hey, Corwin. Corrrrwin. Corrie. Can I call you Corrie?~ [BD58934]
@58935 = ~No. What is it, Neera?~ [BD58935]
@58936 = ~Nothing too important. I was just wondering how you think we're doing. As a team, I mean. The group of us, working together. Yep. Doing pretty good, huh?~ [BD58936]
@58937 = ~You're doing a good job. Your skills are proving invaluable.~ [BD58937]
@58938 = ~Really?! You mean it? That is... I... I wasn't worried about ME, exactly. It was the team, you know.~ [BD58938]
@58939 = ~It's a good team, Neera. We're fortunate you're part of it.~ [BD58939]
@58940 = ~Mistress Corwin, I take a moment of your time, ja? There is something I must say to you.~ [BD58940]

@58942 = ~Brace yourself, honey.~ [BD58942]
@58943 = ~Of all the warriors Voghiln the Mighty has fought with, and there are many, you are one of the best. To fight at your side is a great honor.~ [BD58943]
@58944 = ~That... that's it? That's all you wanted to say? Nothing about my appearance or the fun we'd have together?~ [BD58944]
@58945 = ~Voghiln does not talk ONLY about the womans. He appreciates a fine warrior when he meets one. Or perhaps it is that you want to hear how beautiful you are, ja?~ [BD58945]
@58946 = ~No, please don't. I mean... I'm fine. Thank you.~ [BD58946]
@58947 = ~ 'Tis good to be on the road again, Minsc, thou and I and our friend, <CHARNAME>.~ [BD58947]
@58948 = ~And Boo. None of this would be possible without him!~ [BD58948]
@58949 = ~Yes, of course. How could I have forgotten Boo?~ [BD58949]
@58950 = ~How could ANY of us forget? He mentions the little rat nearly every time he opens his mouth.~
@58951 = ~It is like old times again. Action! Adventure! Smashing evil! If there be danger about, Boo and I will protect you.~ [BD58951]
@58952 = ~I have no doubt of it. And I shall try to steer thee rightly in return.~ [BD58952]
@58953 = ~I think you are a strange warrior, Rasaad. Why do you wear no armor, carry no shield?~ [BD58953]
@58954 = ~Armor is too restrictive. It is better to never feel a blow than to expend energy warding it off.~ [BD58954]
@58955 = ~Speak for yourself, monk. Pain strengthens the body and the mind.~ [BD58955]
@58956 = ~Why not do both? Wrap yourself in steel and then do your fancy dodging dance for double the protection! Even Minsc could not hurt you then!~ [BD58956]
@58957 = ~I do not think—~ [BD58957]
@58958 = ~No, no. You are right. My mighty blows hit EVERYTHING. Ha! Even monks dancing in plate mail! Ha! What was I thinking? Ha!~ [BD58958]
@58959 = ~Minsc has a message for you.~ [BD58959]
@58960 = ~For me? From who?~ [BD58960]
@58961 = ~It is from Boo! He would like to say that you are a very pretty lady. Yes, and Boo has excellent taste, so this is quite a compliment. Relish it.~ [BD58961]
@58962 = ~Your rat thinks I'm pretty, hm? That's adorable.~ [BD58962]
@58963 = ~Boo is no rat! He is a miniature giant space hamster. Do not offend him, lest he nibble your ears off in your sleep!~ [BD58963]
@58964 = ~Rat, hamster, what's the difference?~ [BD58964]
@58965 = ~What is the difference? Oh, Safana! You have so much to learn.~ [BD58965]
@58966 = ~You've given me much to think about. Why don't you bother someone else while I do so? Good boy.~ [BD58966]
@58967 = ~You show such devotion to your companions. Your witch and your... hamster, is it? It's an appealing trait you have.~ [BD58967]
@58968 = ~Ho! What game do you play here, evil elf lady? It will take more than compliments to make Minsc trust you!~ [BD58968]
@58969 = ~Hm. The barbarian's not COMPLETELY without sense. Who'd have thought?~ [BD58969]
@58970 = ~You are too suspicious, pale one. I merely made an observation.~ [BD58970]
@58971 = ~You do more than that—you said loyalty is "appealing." But Minsc has heard that drow betray each other at every turn.~ [BD58971]
@58972 = ~Oh, they do. That is why your loyalty appeals.~ [BD58972]
@58973 = ~Such muscles you have! Why if you were to have brains where your muscles were, imagine the wizard you could be!~
@58974 = ~A muscle-bound wizard with brains where his muscles should be? That does not sound much like Minsc.~
@58975 = ~Well, of course it's not. I'm saying if, you cretin, IF. A hypothesis, a conjecture. Do you not understand? (Get ahold of yourself; you're used to this by now!)~
@58976 = ~No, I do not think Minsc would enjoy that. He would cast a spell to return his muscles to their proper place. Boo is all the brains Minsc needs.~
@58977 = ~Muttonhead.~
@58978 = ~I do not understand the words you use, evil dark elf man.~ [BD58978]
@58979 = ~The cretinous quandary of a cut-rate consciousness.~ [BD58979]
@58980 = ~Yes, exactly!~ [BD58980]
@58981 = ~Must be nice being big. Your mind's bent, but no one pushes you around.~ [BD58981]
@58982 = ~Who pushes you around, little one? Minsc will show them the pointy end of his sword! Or maybe one of the sharp sides. Decisions, decisions...~ [BD58982]
@58983 = ~Everyone pushes me around. My family. My tribe. Other tribes. Humans. The world.~ [BD58983]
@58984 = ~But you walk free now, yes? There is no mean tribe, no angry humans around telling you what to do?~ [BD58984]
@58985 = ~Not for now.~ [BD58985]
@58986 = ~Then do as Boo does and enjoy the moment. In it you are as big as you need to be.~ [BD58986]
@58987 = ~Gods help me. Minsc, I just had a thought. What if—WHAT IF I'm not a gnome? What if I'm actually a miniature giant space gnome? From spaaaace?~ [BD58987]
@58988 = ~Boo says that's crazy. You are a crazy in the head gnome.~ [BD58988]
@58989 = ~A crazy in the head gnome from spaaaace!~ [BD58989]
@58990 = ~I think not.~ [BD58990]
@58991 = ~I know! It's amazing—my absolute favorite thing about you. Other than Boo, of course. Gotta love the hamster.~ [BD58991]
@58992 = ~You may be crazy in the head, but Boo says you have taste. ~ [BD58992]
@58993 = ~Friend Jaheira. In your travels, you have seen strange and wonderful creatures, yes?~ [BD58993]
@58994 = ~Many, yes.~
@58995 = ~And in your journeys, have you perhaps encountered a giant miniature space hamster other than Boo? A FEMALE giant miniature space hamster?~ [BD58995]
@58996 = ~I think we have more important things to do than this, don't you?~
@58997 = ~Are you sure? Boo is restless...~ [BD58997]
@58998 = ~D-do you think we will achieve victory over the crusade, f-friend Minsc?~ [BD58998]
@58999 = ~You doubt it? Look at our stalwart selves! Minsc is more stalwart than many, true, but you are not without a certain stalwartness yourself.~ [BD58999]
@59000 = ~Khalid is as stalwart as they come. None could say otherwise.~
@59001 = ~Our friend is a brave and wise leader, and of course we have Boo. The crusade will fall beneath our stalwart butt-kicking boots!~
@59002 = ~W-when you put it that way, I have no d-doubt.~ [BD59002]
@59003 = ~Minsc has not met many as strong as he is. But you, evil orc man, you may be as strong as Minsc. Perhaps stronger. Minsc does not say that often.~ [BD59003]
@59004 = ~"May be," ranger? Have no doubt of it. I could snap your bones like twigs and leave you lifeless on the ground.~ [BD59004]
@59005 = ~Aha! That is where you are wrong! For Minsc has Boo and our friend <CHARNAME>. Attack Minsc and you attack us all!~ [BD59005]
@59006 = ~I underestimated you. You offset your weakness allying yourself with the strong—a shrewd strategy.~ [BD59006]
@59007 = ~I have no strategy. Just friendship, and that friendship makes Minsc stronger than you will ever be.~ [BD59007]
@59008 = ~Can Minsc give you some advice, lovely elf lady?~
@59009 = ~Is this advice from your hamster friend? ~ [BD59009]
@59010 = ~You wish. No, this comes from Minsc himself.~
@59011 = ~Too bad. I love that little hamster. He's the cutest thing! I wish I had a miniature giant space hamster.~
@59012 = ~I understand your envy. Do you want to hear my advice, little witch?~
@59013 = ~Hit me. No, stand back! It's a figure of speech. Tell me. That's what I meant to say. Tell me.~
@59014 = ~Many do not understand Minsc. And many do not understand your witchery. We can do nothing about this. People will do as they will, understand or not.~ [BD59014]
@59015 = ~To be happy, you must be true even though you are misunderstood. And if you can, get a witch and a hamster! They are good things to have.~ [BD59015]
@59016 = ~That's... actually pretty good advice. Huh. Thanks, big guy.~ [BD59016]
@59017 = ~Minsc, mine friend, I am thinking you need to relax. For warriors such as us, fighting should be for fun.~ [BD59017]
@59018 = ~Fighting evil is fun.~ [BD59018]
@59019 = ~But you seem not to enjoy the thrill of battle. You holler so loud banshees cringe, but I am never seeing a smile as you hack a foe to bloody chunks.~ [BD59019]
@59020 = ~I enjoy battle. I enjoy it much more than the people whose butts I kick.~ [BD59020]
@59021 = ~Being happier than one who is miserable, this is no great feat. Where is the joy, ranger? I ask you this, where is the joy?~ [BD59021]
@59022 = ~Boo was right about you, skald. You do not understand the Ice Dragon spirit.~ [BD59022]
@59023 = ~I feel comfortable in thy presence, monk. Thou hast a serenity about thee that pleases me.~ [BD59023]
@59024 = ~I am glad to hear it. But my heart is not so peaceful as it may seem. There are days, many days I yet find... trying.~ [BD59024]
@59025 = ~The worthy will ever strive to better themselves, but if I understand thy story correctly, thou art to be commended for how far thou hast come in life.~ [BD59025]
@59026 = ~I thank you for the compliment. Would that I could see in myself what you see in me.~ [BD59026]
@59027 = ~I do not know if I fully trust thee, Safana.~ [BD59027]
@59028 = ~I wouldn't if I were you. My mother always said, "You can always trust a man to do the wrong thing, but never trust a woman to do anything."~ [BD59028]
@59029 = ~Thy mother had a dim view of humanity.~ [BD59029]
@59030 = ~She knew humanity well. That does tend to adversely affect one's view of it, in my experience.~ [BD59030]
@59031 = ~Thou'rt thy mother's daughter.~ [BD59031]
@59032 = ~So she claimed. I have my doubts.~ [BD59032]
@59033 = ~Thou hast poor reasons for making this journey, drow.~ [BD59033]
@59034 = ~There are better reasons than survival and profit? I've yet to find them.~ [BD59034]
@59035 = ~Thou'rt in the Underdark no longer. Perhaps thou should'st make more of an effort to adapt to the surface world's ways.~ [BD59035]
@59036 = ~And if I did, what would it benefit me? My skin is black, my hair white. I am drow. Nothing I do will change how surfacers see me.~ [BD59036]
@59037 = ~Thou'rt wrong, Viconia. In the end, actions are what define us—not the color of our skin.~ [BD59037]
@59038 = ~That is what you want to believe, waela. I have been taught differently, and I learned my lessons well.~ [BD59038]
@59039 = ~Thou hast an odd way of speaking, master Barrityl.~ [BD59039]
@59040 = ~You see MY speech as strange? My sides split!~ [BD59040]
@59041 = ~What dost thou mean?~ [BD59041]
@59042 = ~I appreciate an accomplished affectation as much as the next dark elf. But thees and thous are for actors and authors, not actual everyday elocution.~ [BD59042]
@59043 = ~Thou talk'st in riddles, drow.~ [BD59043]
@59044 = ~Uh-huh. Well, absolutely go on as you are. It's inferior entertainment for an enlightened observer, but in the absence of other amusement, I'll accept it.~ [BD59044]
@59045 = ~Thou'rt like no other goblin I have ever met, M'Khiin.~ [BD59045]
@59046 = ~What's a "thou"?~ [BD59046]
@59047 = ~Hm. In truth, I'd not given the matter much consideration before now. How to explain this? Well... thou'rt thou. ~ [BD59047]
@59048 = ~So... "thou" means "you."~ [BD59048]
@59049 = ~Thou hast the truth of it. That is exactly right.~ [BD59049]
@59050 = ~I'd just say "you." It's easier. But talk how you want. Doesn't matter, long as you're happy. Thou're happy.~ [BD59050]
@59051 = ~"Thou'rt."~ [BD59051]
@59052 = ~Huh?~ [BD59052]
@59053 = ~Never thee mind.~ [BD59053]
@59054 = ~You've an interesting way of talking. I mean your language, not your means. My second cousin twice removed could make his posterior talk. Better company than he was.~ [BD59054]
@59055 = ~I do not understand what thou art trying to say.~ [BD59055]
@59056 = ~See, it's that, that right there. Thees and thous and thines. Isn't it easier to use yous and yous again and yours?~ [BD59056]
@59057 = ~When one's power comes from incantation, it is a wise wychlaran who keeps her tongue limber.~ [BD59057]
@59058 = ~Oh, oh, oh, so you do it to retain clarity, make sure your mouth can form the words and keep your mind sharp, that's what you're saying. Thou'rt saying?~ [BD59058]
@59059 = ~Perhaps that is the truth. Perhaps I just prefer a more formal affect. Who is to say?~ [BD59059]
@59060 = ~You're not going to tell me one way or the other, are you? Oh, I LIKE thee...~ [BD59060]
@59061 = ~It is good to once again travel with a woman who understands the trials of a life of adventure.~
@59062 = ~Tis no easy life for thee or me, that is true. Danger awaits at every turn. There shall be no quiet home life for us, at least not for some time to come.~ [BD59062]
@59063 = ~I meant that you understand what it is to look after a man on the road.~
@59064 = ~Ah, yes, thou hast the truth of it. Without us to act as guide and mother and taskmistress all in one...~ [BD59064]
@59065 = ~The poor dears would stand no chance.~
@59066 = ~Thy actions in Bridgefort were impressive, Calishite. Without thee, it would surely have fallen well before we arrived.~ [BD59066]
@59067 = ~I did only what had to be done under the circumstances.~ [BD59067]
@59068 = ~It fell in the end, despite my b-best efforts.~ [BD59068]
@59069 = ~Some battles cannot be won, no matter the skill or the will of he who fights it. Be at peace with that, and thyself. Thou hast nothing to be ashamed of.~ [BD59069]
@59070 = ~Thank you, Dynaheir. It's n-nice of you to say. Perhaps someday I'll be able to be-be-believe it.~ [BD59070]
@59071 = ~Thou'rt as modest as thou art courageous. Noble to the core. I understand what Jaheira sees in thee.~ [BD59071]
@59072 = ~Oh. Uh, yes. Jaheira. I—well. Yes. I, I, I thank you, my l-lady. I'll just— Thank you.~ [BD59072]
@59073 = ~Thou art blushing! Couldst thou be more adorable? I think not.~ [BD59073]
@59074 = ~Boo says you could not be more adorable. And look at Boo, look at that face, eh? He knows adorable.~ [BD59074]
@59075 = ~Thou'rt as modest as thou art courageous. Noble to the core. I begin to see what Jaheira saw in thee.~ [BD59075]
@59076 = ~I am watching thee, half-orc. Do not think thy deeds go unnoticed, or that they shall go unpunished.~ [BD59076]
@59077 = ~I've been judged by better than you, witch, and better still have tried to punish me. None have come to good ends.~ [BD59077]
@59078 = ~I have faced more fearsome things than thee, dark one.~ [BD59078]
@59079 = ~Your responsibility is to die by my hand?~
@59080 = ~Raise your hand to Dynaheir and you are the one who will be dying, half-orc.~
@59081 = ~You wanted to tell me I was observed. You have done so. When—if—you decide to do more than watch... well, that will be most interesting.~ [BD59081]
@59082 = ~We shall see.~ [BD59082]
@59083 = ~No, Boo! I do not like him either, but crawling into his armor to bite and tickle him would be unseemly for a hamster of your elevated stature.~ [BD59083]
@59084 = ~Wild magic is a defect in the Weave, one that may in time unravel the Weave itself. Thou'rt a grave danger to thyself and others, Neera.~ [BD59084]
@59085 = ~Hey, Dynaheir, thanks for telling me something I didn't already know from painful personal experience.~ [BD59085]
@59086 = ~Flaming obvious! Good one.~ [BD59086]
@59087 = ~What are you talking about now?~ [BD59087]
@59088 = ~That wasn't a joke? I mean... you burn things, right? So when you said "flaming obvious," I thought... well, you see where one could... Shutting up now.~ [BD59088]
@59089 = ~Wouldst thou learn how to properly turn the Weave to thine own purpose, Neera?~ [BD59089]
@59090 = ~Will it take long?~ [BD59090]
@59091 = ~Learning the proper use of magic takes years, decades. Surely thou knowest that already?~ [BD59091]
@59092 = ~Yeah... That's sorta why I stopped training. Also the thing with the fire. I think I'll keep muddling by on my own.~ [BD59092]
@59093 = ~As thou wish'st. But thou'rt making a mistake.~ [BD59093]
@59094 = ~At this point, I'm pretty used to that. Thanks, though.~ [BD59094]
@59095 = ~Voghiln. Thou art from the north, art thou not?~ [BD59095]
@59096 = ~Ja, this is true! I called Luskan home for many years, though I often ventured out into the cold and snow of the Spine of the World.~ [BD59096]
@59097 = ~I have never been to thy city. Perhaps when my task is complete, I will venture there and see it for mineself.
~ [BD59097]
@59098 = ~If you would be liking a personal guide, beauteous one, I know a skald that may be able to help you out. I cannot recommend him highly enough, ho ho!~ [BD59098]
@59099 = ~I shall consider this. For now, I will settle for hearing more tales of your land.~ [BD59099]
@59100 = ~Do you think we shall be successful in our campaign against the crusade, my lady?~
@59101 = ~How should I know? I'm no strategist. I know one thing for certain, though: I'm getting out of this alive.~
@59102 = ~None of us can know our eventual fate. The gods and destiny play a hand in everything we do.~
@59103 = ~Says you. I say we control our own destinies. And whichever way this ill-fated campaign goes, I'll be standing at the end. Whatever it takes. Got that, sweetheart?~ [BD59103]
@59104 = ~If you say so, my lady.~ [BD59104]
@59105 = ~Sharran.~ [BD59105]
@59106 = ~Selûnite.~ [BD59106]
@59107 = ~For the moment, we must focus all our attention on Caelar's crusade. But when that is dealt with, we shall have words, you and I.~
@59108 = ~I look forward to it, ussta ogglin. You will be crying out my name in the dark before I finish with you.~
@59109 = ~I what? No, I meant we would... You misunderstand.~
@59110 = ~One of us does. I've never seen anyone turn that shade of red before. Perhaps you have learned a lesson today?~
@59111 = ~Master Odesseiron, I understand you hail from the country of Thay?~ [BD59111]
@59112 = ~Who told you that?! Have you been spying on me? A SPY, are you?~ [BD59112]
@59113 = ~No, not at all. You wear the colors of a Red Wizard and have referenced your home country several times.~ [BD59113]
@59114 = ~So you SAY... I'm on to you, monkey-monk. I'm watching you. Never forget that.~ [BD59114]
@59115 = ~I shall endeavor to keep this in mind.~ [BD59115]
@59116 = ~You've quite the quick and cunning combat style there, monk. Precise, powerful, just a pinch unpredictable.~ [BD59116]
@59117 = ~I learned to fight on the streets of Calimport. Perhaps I bring some of that recklessness to my combat even now.~ [BD59117]
@59118 = ~P-perhaps one day we could speak of C-calimport. I've not see-seen it for some t-time.~ [BD59118]
@59119 = ~A scintillating sparring style with no shortage of showmanship! Would you consider investing in an innovative arrangement? What I mean is—~ [BD59119]
@59120 = ~I understand well what you mean. My answer is no.~ [BD59120]
@59121 = ~A shame. But should your stance shift, be sure to say so.~ [BD59121]
@59122 = ~...so the Moonmaiden and her twin, Shar, are set one against the other, light battling darkness for all time.~ [BD59122]
@59123 = ~Maglubiyet eats whole cows.~ [BD59123]
@59124 = ~Er, I do not think you understand. Our Lady of Silver, Selûne, is with us in the light of the moon, you see. And Shar is ever present in the shadows.~ [BD59124]
@59125 = ~Does Selûne eat whole cows?~ [BD59125]
@59126 = ~I do not think so.~ [BD59126]
@59127 = ~Maglubiyet does. Maybe you should worship him.~ [BD59127]
@59128 = ~Your second-string surface gods are adorable. Ultimately, it's inevitable: The Spider Queen will eviscerate her enemies!~ [BD59128]
@59129 = ~Mmm... I will attend to other matters now, I think.~ [BD59129]
@59130 = ~...So she's the goddess of stars and navigation and wanderers. Sounds pretty good so far.~ [BD59130]
@59131 = ~Selûne is also worshipped by goodly lycanthropes.~ [BD59131]
@59132 = ~Goodly werewolves? Didn't know there was such a thing. Well, let's give that a pass. What I get caught up on is the light aspect. ~ [BD59132]
@59133 = ~Without light, all would be darkness.~ [BD59133]
@59134 = ~That's true, that's undoubtedly true, a bit of a tautology, but I see what you're getting at, but... No. No, the light is just no good for me.~ [BD59134]
@59135 = ~I'm sure it's fine for some—a friend to most, even. But gnomes do better when we go unnoticed. Less trouble that way, you know?~ [BD59135]
@59136 = ~I believe I do.~ [BD59136]
@59137 = ~But thanks for explaining Selûne to me. It really was very interesting, and I expect you'll do quite well as one of her servants. ~ [BD59137]
@59138 = ~Forgive me, Jaheira, but I do not understand. I thought you a champion of goodness. You say you are not?~ [BD59138]
@59139 = ~There is no good in nature, nor evil, either. The wolf devours the rabbit. Is this good or evil, do you think?~
@59140 = ~Well... neither, I suppose.~
@59141 = ~You monks sit in libraries, perusing musty tomes about good and evil. I do not make such distinctions. My world—the natural world—simply is.~
@59142 = ~Of course the druid disparages libraries. Only the refined can truly appreciate those cradles of knowledge and wells of arcane power.~
@59143 = ~An... interesting perspective. I shall have to think upon it.~
@59144 = ~Perhaps you could find a book to help clear the matter up.~
@59145 = ~An excellent idea. Have you any suggest... oh. You are teasing me now, yes?~
@59146 = ~There may be hope for you yet, Rasaad.~
@59147 = ~You are familiar with Calimport then?~ [BD59147]
@59148 = ~Oh y-yes! I spent many a h-happy hour at the Jet Jambiya. Wonderful ale.~ [BD59148]
@59149 = ~I remember it well. My brother and I would often linger outside the better taverns, looking for inebriated patrons to, ah, relieve of their valuables.~ [BD59149]
@59150 = ~I can't say it didn't happen to me from t-time to time. Perhaps you picked my pocket!~ [BD59150]
@59151 = ~Oh. Yes. Forgive me, my friend. I feel great shame for much of what I did before finding Selûne.~ [BD59151]
@59152 = ~I'm sorry, Rasaad. Making you uncomfortable was the l-last thing I wanted. Please, think nothing of it.~ [BD59152]
@59153 = ~I shall try to do so. I suppose I have not entirely put those days behind me. Even now they find a way to disrupt my serenity.~ [BD59153]
@59154 = ~I'll admit you are not without skill in combat, monk. Do not think that gives you license to challenge me.~ [BD59154]
@59155 = ~Why would I want to? I have no quarrel with you. And in the matter of Caelar, at least, we share a goal.~ [BD59155]
@59156 = ~I know your kind. All who sanctimoniously embrace "goodness" salivate at the very idea of my fall.~ [BD59156]
@59157 = ~And those who walk the path of evil will never know peace. I can imagine no fate worse than that.~ [BD59157]
@59158 = ~Perhaps if you learned to meditate, you would start fewer fires...~ [BD59158]
@59159 = ~No one's EVER going to let the fire thing go, are they? All right. I burn things. It happens.~ [BD59159]
@59160 = ~Most refrain from setting their own dwellings aflame when preparing a repast.~ [BD59160]
@59161 = ~"Most" people live in fear and misery. Maybe they SHOULD set their houses on fire to make dinner. Ever think of that?~ [BD59161]
@59162 = ~I admit, I had not.~ [BD59162]
@59163 = ~I think you may be on to something, Neera. What about a—a—a "fire box"? Something that continually emits fireballs! You could cook a potato in no time!~ [BD59163]
@59164 = ~You have spent your entire life learning the tales of your people, then, Voghiln?~ [BD59164]
@59165 = ~Each story has as many versions as there are elders to tell it. Each skald must take the pieces and make the tale his own.~ [BD59165]
@59166 = ~How can you be sure what you are telling is true, then?~ [BD59166]
@59167 = ~Ho ho! Is it truth you are seeking, or is it facts? Facts are simple, they are constant—anyone can be learning facts! Truth, though—this is not so simple.~ [BD59167]
@59168 = ~But ultimately, there can be but one truth—THE truth. Is this not so?~ [BD59168]
@59169 = ~You would make a poor skald, my friend.~ [BD59169]
@59170 = ~You've got a pretty good racket going on there.~ [BD59170]
@59171 = ~Pardon, rivvil?~ [BD59171]
@59172 = ~The "lady of mystery" thing. The beautiful drow: Who is she? What's her story? Subtlety—it drives men crazy. Maybe I'll give it a try someday.~ [BD59172]
@59173 = ~I wouldn't. It's not in your nature.~ [BD59173]
@59174 = ~How old ARE you, Thayan? You act like a child. Stop leering at me and look elsewhere.~ [BD59174]
@59175 = ~You flatter yourself, wench. I care naught for your tawdry charms. I was studying your cranium. ~ [BD59175]
@59176 = ~Sure you were.~ [BD59176]
@59177 = ~Your head is plump and relatively well shaped compared to these cretins. Your brain might be adequate for wizardly pursuits.~ [BD59177]
@59178 = ~A compliment for my mind? That's a new one.~ [BD59178]
@59179 = ~You saucy strumpet, Safana. Your savory spirit stimulates me as scant few things do.~ [BD59179]
@59180 = ~I hope my spirit satisfies you, drow. You'll not be savoring anything else I possess.~ [BD59180]
@59181 = ~Never say never, darling.~ [BD59181]
@59182 = ~Never tell me what to say, "darling."~ [BD59182]
@59183 = ~What have we here? Is that a dagger's hilt in your hand, or are you just happy to see me?~ [BD59183]
@59184 = ~I'm not happy to see you.~ [BD59184]
@59185 = ~Your small-minded stance saddens me. We could've had something, were you not so steadfast in this silly stubbornness.~ [BD59185]
@59186 = ~I could make you sadder still, Barrityl. Find another playmate.~ [BD59186]
@59187 = ~You have a way with the womens, Baeloth. Your way leads right off a cliff, but it certainly is a way, that is undeniable, ho ho hoho!~ [BD59187]
@59188 = ~Maybe no one likes you because goblins are hideous little creatures, inside and out.~ [BD59188]
@59189 = ~Maybe.~ [BD59189]
@59190 = ~You're agreeing with me?~ [BD59190]
@59191 = ~Lived with goblins all my life. They are ugly. Think you know, but you don't.~ [BD59191]
@59192 = ~You're a woman of the world, Safana. You've experienced everything Toril has to offer, in all its glory and perhaps its squalor, yes...?~ [BD59192]
@59193 = ~Are you calling me old?~ [BD59193]
@59194 = ~What? No.~ [BD59194]
@59195 = ~You knee-biting little vagabond! I am a young woman in the prime of my life!~ [BD59195]
@59196 = ~I never said otherwise...~ [BD59196]
@59197 = ~You said more than enough. Talk to me like that again and I'll slap you so hard it'll knock the taste out of your grandmother's mouth.~ [BD59197]
@59198 = ~Forgive me, Safana. I just wanted to ask about your life in Baldur's Gate. You seem like such an interesting person...~ [BD59198]
@59199 = ~Well, you're right about the last bit at least.~ [BD59199]
@59200 = ~Womans, ja? What can you do?~ [BD59200]
@59201 = ~I think I'll keep doing what I've usually done—but more so.~ [BD59201]
@59202 = ~Nature? Who needs it? Burrs in your hair, spiders in the soup. Sleeping on rocks. Not a bathhouse in sight.~ [BD59202]
@59203 = ~Your eyes are open, but you see nothing. Witness the glowing colors of a sunrise. Hear a bird trill in the early dawn. It is breathtaking.~
@59204 = ~That's well and good for you. The outdoorsy look suits you and in any event you've already got a man. Me, I need silk sheets and bubble baths.~
@59205 = ~Your loss.~
@59206 = ~Keep on telling yourself that.~
@59207 = ~I-is it true that you sailed on a pirate ship?~ [BD59207]
@59208 = ~Now, Khalid. Does that sound like something I would do?~ [BD59208]
@59209 = ~I'm from Calimshan too. I've heard s-stories of the Exzeus. M-most were about ruthless attacks and insatiable greed.~ [BD59209]
@59210 = ~Have you? Did any mention the beautiful woman amongst the crew?~
@59211 = ~Y-yes. It sounds very much like something you would do.~ [BD59211]
@59212 = ~Mm. Flattery will get you everywhere, darling.~ [BD59212]
@59213 = ~I've held my tongue so far, but I've reached my limit. The half-orc reeks of sweat and blood. I can't be the only one who thinks so, can I?~ [BD59213]
@59214 = ~I assure you there are worse things to smell in this world than I, dear lady. Perhaps you are not meant for a life of adventure.~ [BD59214]
@59215 = ~I'm meant for a life of luxury and I've made no secret of it. But I'd settle for one not permeated with the stench of death. It wouldn't kill you take a bath.~ [BD59215]
@59216 = ~While Caelar lives, we have more important things to do than bathe.~ [BD59216]
@59217 = ~If we can't spare even a moment to clean ourselves, the crusaders have won!~ [BD59217]
@59218 = ~That makes no sense.~ [BD59218]
@59219 = ~I was hoping you wouldn't notice that... Bloody hells. Someone give me a drink.~ [BD59219]
@59220 = ~It is a drink you are wanting? Voghiln is there for you.~ [BD59220]
@59221 = ~Pink hair, eh? That's an interesting look.~ [BD59221]
@59222 = ~Sure, make fun of my hair. Why not? Everyone's got SOMEthing to say.~ [BD59222]
@59223 = ~Your hair wasn't always pink?~ [BD59223]
@59224 = ~Uh, no? I figure one of these days a spell will go off and change my hair back. So far, nothing. But it hasn't turned into vipers either, so that's something.~ [BD59224]
@59225 = ~What color was your hair before?~ [BD59225]
@59226 = ~Lavender.~ [BD59226]
@59227 = ~Keep your hands to yourself, you bloody great oaf.~ [BD59227]
@59228 = ~Ho ho ho! She plays hard to get. I know the womans, liebchen. Your mouth says no, but your eyes say maybe.~ [BD59228]
@59229 = ~What does a swift kick 'twixt the legs say?~ [BD59229]
@59230 = ~Ehhh... It says, "Maybe later."~ [BD59230]
@59231 = ~Gods! You're worse than Coran!~ [BD59231]
@59232 = ~...Who?~ [BD59232]
@59233 = ~(Steady, Edwin. Approach casually, make pleasant conversation.) So, Viconia... You are a feebleminded god-slave, and not a wielder of great arcane power?~ [BD59233]
@59234 = ~Hold your tongue, wael, or I will tear it from your mouth. Shar grants me powers beyond your imagining. They are nothing to scoff at.~ [BD59234]
@59235 = ~You misunderstand! I meant only that I am surprised you beg for scraps of power from Shar's table. I had heard the drow are extraordinary wizards.~ [BD59235]

@59244 = ~You can count yourself lucky for that.~ [BD59244]
@59245 = ~Humans and their ilk hate and persecute us. We were both born to vicious societies, with the strongest and most ruthless ruling over the weak.~ [BD59245]
@59246 = ~Sounds like my tribe.~ [BD59246]
@59247 = ~The cringing males creep in our shadows while the women run our great cities.~ [BD59247]

@59249 = ~We have gnomes in the Underdark as well, you know.~ [BD59249]
@59250 = ~Svirfneblin? I wouldn't call them gnomes, exactly. Not GNOME-gnomes. They're a dour lot, aren't they? Dusty. And grim.~ [BD59250]

@59253 = ~We drow make tenacious enemies. Their luck may not last.~ [BD59253]
@59254 = ~It's little wonder the drow are so evil and twisted. To never see the sun or breathe fresh air... it is not a healthy way to live.~
@59255 = ~You only say so because the sun does not burn you, darthiir.~
@59256 = ~You have walked beside me in the light before. The sun hurts you no more than it does any other.~

@59261 = ~I am merely walking, abban. No need for alarm.~ [BD59261]
@59262 = ~You should know I d-don't trust you. I'm prepared to defend myself.~ [BD59262]
@59263 = ~From what? I've no desire to harm you. Our goals are aligned, for the moment.~ [BD59263]
@59264 = ~It's the m-moment they aren't that worries me.~ [BD59264]
@59265 = ~So you too know how it feels to receive instruction from a higher power.~ [BD59265]
@59266 = ~Do not compare your worship of Shar to the patronage of Ur-Gothoz. They are nothing alike.~ [BD59266]

@59268 = ~We are in no way alike, drow. Ur-Gothoz is no remote deity. His orders sound with perfect clarity in my ear.~ [BD59268]
@59269 = ~I wonder, is there anyone you would be content being compared to?~ [BD59269]
@59270 = ~There are none like me. None can understand the path I walk.~ [BD59270]

@59273 = ~Even you cannot be so fool as to ask this in earnest. Is this some ill-advised attempt at humor?~ [BD59273]
@59274 = ~Viconia, then. Fine. In that case, you must call me Neera.~ [BD59274]
@59275 = ~I have called you nothing else.~ [BD59275]
@59276 = ~Haven't you ever wanted to, though? Maybe... Neers?~ [BD59276]
@59277 = ~Definitely not.~ [BD59277]
@59278 = ~Peanut? Doll? Pinky?~ [BD59278]
@59279 = ~Your antics do not amuse me, girl. Begone.~ [BD59279]

@59284 = ~You're fat.~ [BD59284]
@59285 = ~You insolent monkey! How dare you speak to me thus? I should flay the flesh from your bones and make the air heavy with your screams!~ [BD59285]

@59287 = ~You see the disrespect it shows me? Again I ask, how has it come to this?~ [BD59287]
@59288 = ~Don't know. Don't care. Keep whining if you want. I'm done with you.~ [BD59288]
@59289 = ~You are not unattractive, Jaheira. Opinionated and overly loud, but even so. Tell me, why do you waste your time with that st-st-stuttering ape Khalid?~
@59290 = ~He makes better company than small-minded, cruel little reptiles who would mock a person for their speech.~
@59291 = ~Cruel I may be—I live in a cruel world, which is to say the real world. But small-minded? I take exception to that, dear lady.~
@59292 = ~Take what you will. I care as much for your feelings as you do for Khalid's.~
@59293 = ~Then you are a greater fool than that oaf you call a husband. I am done with you.~
@59294 = ~I am glad to hear it.~

@59299 = ~We are in agreement, then?~ [BD59299]
@59300 = ~You are powerful, Thayan. But you are not strong. I'll not chain my fortunes to a pampered, simpering child, no matter how many fireballs he juggles.~ [BD59300]
@59301 = ~You impudent wretch! How DARE you—er, what I mean is, you should not pass up this opportunity. I urge you, reconsider your position.~ [BD59301]
@59302 = ~Or what? You'll mutter at me? I want nothing to do with you, wizard. And you would do well to expect nothing from me.~ [BD59302]
@59303 = ~So, Edwin. Ed-winnn. Eddie. Ed. Can I call you Ed?~ [BD59303]
@59304 = ~Why are you speaking to me and how do I make you stop?~ [BD59304]
@59305 = ~Well—you're a Red Wizard, right? And I've had some... issues... with them. I was wondering if you could maybe help me out?~ [BD59305]
@59306 = ~I could... but I won't. I don't like you, half-elf. I spent years mastering my craft. And you... YOU...~ [BD59306]
@59307 = ~So you won't help me because you're jealous?~ [BD59307]
@59308 = ~Jealous? JEALOUS? You know as little of me as you do magic. Go, leave me be, your nattering makes my head ache.~ [BD59308]
@59309 = ~See? You should think about it, Ed. Revolutionize your country. ~
@59310 = ~Skald! If you dare include Edwin Odesseiron in one of your tales you will learn what SCALD means in Thay, courtesy of a burning fan of flame!~ [BD59310]
@59311 = ~Eh. It is your loss.~ [BD59311]
@59312 = ~GOOD. I am far too important a personage to be sung about in taverns and bawdy houses by capering imbeciles!~ [BD59312]
@59313 = ~But if you do put me in, it's Edwin Odesseiron. ODESSEIRON. One D, two S's.~

@59319 = ~You don't even know what the words you say mean, do you?~ [BD59319]
@59320 = ~You cretinous creature! My conversational comprehension is quite beyond compare!~ [BD59320]
@59321 = ~Still don't know what turdiform means.~ [BD59321]
@59322 = ~The connotation is clear, considering the context.~ [BD59322]
@59323 = ~What does it mean?~ [BD59323]
@59324 = ~Nix the nitpicking, you know-it-all nag, or I'll, I'll—~ [BD59324]
@59325 = ~Turdiform me?~ [BD59325]
@59326 = ~Why am I even talking to you?~ [BD59326]
@59327 = ~You have some mighty muscles there, mistress—~ [BD59327]
@59328 = ~Be silent, drow. I have no interest in fighting in your pit.~
@59329 = ~You misunderstand! I only observed that your obvious skill seems suitable—~
@59330 = ~I do not misunderstand. You've been asking everyone to fight in your pit. Recruiting new "talent" is likely the only reason you came on this journey.~
@59331 = ~Not true! I care considerably about quashing this cruel crusade! Our campaign will crush the contemptible Caeless!~
@59332 = ~"Caelar."~
@59333 = ~Eh. Whatever.~
@59334 = ~You were coached for combat in Calimshan, yes, Khalid? Quite the country, Calimshan. Its coliseums cultivated many a capital competitor.~ [BD59334]
@59335 = ~Do you kn-know much about, about f-f-fighting styles?~ [BD59335]
@59336 = ~I would be a poor practitioner of my profession if I did not.~ [BD59336]
@59337 = ~What do you do, p-precisely?~ [BD59337]
@59338 = ~Makes slaves fight each other for money.~ [BD59338]

@59340 = ~Khalid! Come away from that vile slaver.~
@59341 = ~I-I don't think my wife would approve.~ [BD59341]
@59342 = ~Well, when you ditch the deadweight, do come discuss the destiny you desire with this dutiful drow.~ [BD59342]
@59343 = ~I fight because I m-must, not to, to entertain. I want n-no part of your pits. Find another stooge, drow.~ [BD59343]
@59344 = ~Lolth's lanky legs, you are a strappy little shaver, Dorn. Ever flirted with fighting to a fatal finish for fun and profit? Mostly profit?~ [BD59344]

@59346 = ~Ah. You already retain representation, then.~ [BD59346]
@59347 = ~My patron supplies me with all that I need.~ [BD59347]

@59349 = ~Do not delude yourself into believing you comprehend the scope of MY ambition, drow. Begone!~ [BD59349]
@59350 = ~A wily wizardess like you would make a worthy pit warrior! None would know what you might sorcer up next!~ [BD59350]
@59351 = ~Hm... I can see it. Neera the Magnificent, they'd call me! What will I do to my next opponent? Turn them into a hedgehog? Or make their blood ACID?~ [BD59351]
@59352 = ~It's not as fun as you think, half-elf.~ [BD59352]
@59353 = ~Such spirit! I shall study your strengths when our current campaign concludes.~ [BD59353]
@59354 = ~Of course, I'd be just as likely to turn the audience's blood to acid. That would be one downside. But an audience of hedgehogs would be adorable!~ [BD59354]
@59355 = ~Ah. I start to see some shortcomings with my speculative assessment of your suitability. Let us leave the matter for the moment.~ [BD59355]
@59356 = ~Forsooth, my fine fellow, your facial fungus is phenomenal.~ [BD59356]

@59363 = ~Verily.~ [BD59363]
@59364 = ~I'm curious, M'Khiin. What was your life like before this? What's it like being a goblin?~ [BD59364]
@59365 = ~What's it like being a gnome?~ [BD59365]
@59366 = ~Depends on the gnome, really. I get to go places and do things and meet new people. And being a gnome, I get away with some pretty crazy things.~ [BD59366]
@59367 = ~Being a goblin isn't like that. At all.~ [BD59367]
@59368 = ~Oh. I'm sorry to hear that.~ [BD59368]
@59369 = ~Used to it.~ [BD59369]

@59382 = ~Just want them to think enough times that they don't kill me.~ [BD59382]
@59383 = ~And if Caelar or one of her lackeys removes your protector <CHARNAME> permanently?~ [BD59383]
@59384 = ~If this, if that—can't worry about ifs. Too many of 'em. What is is all that matters.~ [BD59384]
@59385 = ~So M'Khiin, that thing you do with ghosts? Really neat. Not for the person under ghost attack, or probably for the ghosts, but watching it? Neat!~ [BD59385]
@59386 = ~If you say so.~ [BD59386]
@59387 = ~I wish I could do something like that. Well, I could do something LIKE that, but not exactly. I wouldn't be able to control it so well, probably, but it'd still be...~ [BD59387]
@59388 = ~Neat.~ [BD59388]
@59389 = ~REALLY neat. You have to show me how to do it sometime. And I could show you how to do what I do. Well, I couldn't really show you HOW, exactly.~ [BD59389]
@59390 = ~Maybe be quiet now. Don't want to run out of things to talk about next time.~ [BD59390]
@59391 = ~So Jaheira, you and Khalid, you two've been together a while now, have you?~ [BD59391]
@59392 = ~More than ten years, married for eight of them.~
@59393 = ~It feels longer sometimes. The j-joy I feel is s-seemingly without end.~ [BD59393]
@59394 = ~Ten years, that is impressive. And you're happy together? With each other?~ [BD59394]
@59395 = ~I c-cannot picture a life without my love Jaheira.~ [BD59395]
@59396 = ~Oh, that's just lack of imagination. We can work on that.~ [BD59396]
@59397 = ~Why do you ask these things?~
@59398 = ~Hm? Oh, no reason. Just trying to, you know, get to know the members of my party. Is there anything you'd like to know about me?~ [BD59398]
@59399 = ~If I think of something, I'll let you know.~
@59400 = ~Hey, Khalid, I just wanted to say, what you did at Bridgefort, that was very good of you. You really did right by those people.~ [BD59400]
@59401 = ~I t-tried. I don't know how successful I was.~ [BD59401]
@59402 = ~You're being way too hard on yourself. You need to relax, you really really do. I'm getting edgy just standing next to you.~ [BD59402]
@59403 = ~You know what is at s-stake in this venture, Glint. How am I supposed to relax, with the Sword Coast's fate in the balance?~ [BD59403]
@59404 = ~It's easy. Just do what I say. First, close your eyes, that's right, take a deep breath. Hold it, holllld it, now release... good... Now...~ [BD59404]
@59405 = ~RELAX!~ [BD59405]
@59406 = ~Ahhh!~ [BD59406]
@59407 = ~See? Easy. Don't you feel better now? I feel better now.~ [BD59407]
@59408 = ~So, Dorn. Dorn, Dorn, Dornnn...~ [BD59408]
@59409 = ~You have something to say to me, gnome? Then say it, or say nothing at all.~ [BD59409]
@59410 = ~I was just going to ask you how the weather was up there.~ [BD59410]
@59411 = ~What?~ [BD59411]
@59412 = ~It was a joke, you know. How's the weather up there, because it'd be different. Because you're, uh, tall.~ [BD59412]
@59413 = ~You should go away now.~ [BD59413]
@59414 = ~Yes. Yes, I think I'll be doing that right... now. Yes.~ [BD59414]
@59415 = ~In my defense, you are VERY tall. All right, I'm done, going now, yes, yes.~ [BD59415]
@59416 = ~Yeah, yeahyeahyeahyeahyeah, I've seen those once or twice. They are aMAZing. The way they fly through the air and then, you know...~ [BD59416]
@59417 = ~I totally know! Like how they do that thing, that twisty thing?~ [BD59417]
@59418 = ~LOVE the twisty thing.~ [BD59418]
@59419 = ~The one I saw did a DOUBLE twisty thing.~ [BD59419]
@59420 = ~NO. A double twisty bit? That's—Cloakshadow's black silk lining, I can't even think what it'd be like with a double twisty thing.~ [BD59420]
@59421 = ~I was impressed. But it's real dangerous. I'm surprised the big man didn't have his nose melted, you know?~ [BD59421]
@59422 = ~Oh, the nose melt. I saw that once, just with a single twist. Not pleasant. But for a double twisty? Totally worth it, I'd say.~ [BD59422]
@59423 = ~It really, really was. That was a good day.~ [BD59423]
@59424 = ~I'll bet.~ [BD59424]
@59425 = ~Does anyone know what the hells these two are talking about?~ [BD59425]
@59426 = ~Gardening, I think.~ [BD59426]
@59427 = ~..."That was no goat, that was my wife!" And the drunkard says to him, he says, he says, "By the Oakfather's mossy beard! I thought she was both!"~ [BD59427]
@59428 = ~So the sheepherder's wife looked like a goat...?~ [BD59428]
@59429 = ~Ja, she looked like a goat. Ho ho! Funny, eh?~ [BD59429]
@59430 = ~Not that funny for the sheepherder.~ [BD59430]
@59431 = ~You are not the sheepherder, my little friend.~ [BD59431]
@59432 = ~Well, no, obviously not; the sheepherder had a wife. But even so, you have to feel a little bad for the poor fellow, don't you?~ [BD59432]
@59433 = ~No, you don't feel bad for him. It's a joke, and the sheepherder is its butt!~ [BD59433]
@59434 = ~Did someone say butt? Is there one in need of kicking? Minsc is ready!~ [BD59434]
@59435 = ~The sheepherder is funny! You laugh at him! Eh... I guess you had to be there.~ [BD59435]
@59436 = ~Why do we tolerate this villain's presence among us? There are monsters enough in this world without inviting one into our circle.~
@59437 = ~You call me a monster?~
@59438 = ~You deny it?~
@59439 = ~I'll not waste my time arguing with you. Let me suggest this, though: Only a fool goes out of her way to antagonize a monster.~
@59440 = ~Hey Jaheira, have you ever noticed that our names rhyme? When they write epic songs about our deeds here, I bet they'll put our names together a lot!~ [BD59440]
@59441 = ~What makes such strange thoughts flit through your head, child?~
@59442 = ~I don't know... Maybe wild magic makes my thoughts wild too. Mixes them up, like scrambled eggs. On toast. With stewed tomatoes.~
@59443 = ~Maybe some fresh fruit on the side, and a little hot tea. I'm going to go eat. We'll talk later.~
@59444 = ~Come on. Just a little peck on the cheek. What's the harm in that?~ [BD59444]
@59445 = ~It'll be in my husband's fists if he finds out about it.~
@59446 = ~Vot? Your husband raises his hand to you? This is not acceptable.~
@59447 = ~No, you idiot. He'll raise his hand to you. And then bring it down on you, over and over again, like a hammer from the heavens.~
@59448 = ~Oh, he'd hit ME? Ja, this makes more sense.~
@59449 = ~I d-d-don't think I l-like you, half-orc.~ [BD59449]
@59450 = ~I know of a certainty I don't care for you. When you know your own mind, tell me.~ [BD59450]
@59451 = ~I def-definitely don't like you.~ [BD59451]
@59452 = ~Better. Now, what do you plan to do about it? Fight me? Try to kill me? Or do we put our feelings aside and save our hostility for Caelar?~ [BD59452]
@59453 = ~W-were it not for our f-f-friend <CHARNAME>, we would fight.~ [BD59453]
@59454 = ~Congratulations, hero! In addition to Baldur's Gate and the Sword Coast, you have yanked a stuttering fool from the brink of utter destruction. Well done.~ [BD59454]
@59455 = ~You should thank Gorion's ward for saving your life. Khalid would cut you down before you even unsheathed your blade.~
@59456 = ~Well... maybe not QUITE that quickly. Especially as his sword's already drawn.~ [BD59456]
@59457 = ~Your humility is one of the countless reasons I love you, Khalid, but this is not the time for it.~
@59458 = ~Y-yes, dear. As you say.~ [BD59458]
@59459 = ~How are you holding up, Neera?~ [BD59459]
@59460 = ~I'm fine, Khalid. I mean, I will be fine. You know, when this is all over.~ [BD59460]
@59461 = ~You're sure? You're not too t-tense? I mean, obviously we're all under stress, but you're not going to... you know.~ [BD59461]
@59462 = ~No, I don't know. Not going to what?~ [BD59462]
@59463 = ~W-well, there was the... incident at B-bridgefort. I h-hate to bring it up, b-b-but there are s-safety issues...~ [BD59463]
@59464 = ~Oh, for the love of... I'M NOT GOING TO EXPLODE AND BURN EVERYTHING IN THE VICINITY TO ASHES, all right?~ [BD59464]
@59465 = ~Well... Good. That's g-good. Comforting. I'll go... somewhere else now, I think.~ [BD59465]
@59466 = ~S-so Voghiln, I just wanted to th-th-thank you for standing with my wife while I was confined to Bridgefort.~ [BD59466]
@59467 = ~You are a good and noble and very trusting young man, Khalid. Worthy qualities all, ja. I see what Jaheira sees in you.~ [BD59467]
@59468 = ~You are a good and noble and very trusting young man, Khalid. Worthy qualities all, ja. I can see what Jaheira saw in you.~ [BD59468]
@59469 = ~Y-You do? C-can you tell me, sometimes I d-don't see it myself...~ [BD59469]
@59470 = ~Ho ho! You make the joke, ja? Is good one.~ [BD59470]
@59471 = ~Yes. Joking...~ [BD59471]
@59472 = ~Khalid! Stop wasting time with that drunken oaf.~
@59473 = ~Of, of course, beloved. Ex-excuse me, Voghiln. It was good talking to you.~ [BD59473]
@59474 = ~The Luskan Lion is always happy to chat with a fellow warrior. Any time you are in need of the talking, you come find Voghiln. We have a drink, ja?~ [BD59474]
@59475 = ~Hey, Dorn, I've been meaning to ask you something.~ [BD59475]
@59476 = ~I have seen the power you wield, elf. It is impressive—~ [BD59476]
@59477 = ~Half-elf.~ [BD59477]
@59478 = ~I have also endured the endless stream of chatter that tumbles 'twixt your lips.~ [BD59478]
@59479 = ~I just wanted to ask—~ [BD59479]
@59480 = ~Do you value your life, half-elf?~ [BD59480]
@59481 = ~Well, yeah. It's not much, I'll admit, but it's all I've got. And now you're drawing your sword—all right then! Great talk.~ [BD59481]
@59482 = ~Then you know what you must do, and what you must NOT do. And most importantly of all, whom you must never, ever attempt to do it with. Begone.~
@59483 = ~All right then! Great talk.~
@59484 = ~I have heard tales of your exploits, skald, but looking at you now I have trouble believing them. Did you truly conquer the Nightmare Clan?~ [BD59484]
@59485 = ~Ja, this is true. The Nightmares were the terror of the Ten Towns, but no match for mighty Voghiln.~ [BD59485]
@59486 = ~The Nightmares' hands could shatter stone and their fangs were sharper than any dagger, or so the stories go.~ [BD59486]
@59487 = ~On my honor, the stories are true, every word. I wrote many myself.~ [BD59487]
@59488 = ~You wrote the tales of your heroic defeat of the invincible Nightmares? With that, all is explained.~ [BD59488]
@59489 = ~What is that supposed to mean, half-orc? Tell me, what is it you are meaning with your words there?~ [BD59489]
@59490 = ~Answer, you bruise-hued monstrosity! What are you saying about mighty Voghiln? What?~ [BD59490]
@59491 = ~Oh, ja, ja. Just be ignoring me now. This is how men deal with other men where you come from? Pfah! I am laughing at you, you see? Hah! Hah! Laughing!~ [BD59491]
@59492 = ~Oi. I need a drink...~ [BD59492]
@59493 = ~...So the wife looked like a goat?~ [BD59493]
@59494 = ~Ja! And the drunkard thought the sheepherder was married to a goat.~ [BD59494]
@59495 = ~Ha! Hahahaha! Wooo... He thought she was a goat, that's a good one. It's good to laugh. Feels like it's been a while, you know?~ [BD59495]
@59496 = ~Ja, ja. And there are other things I have not done of late. Things better done with a lady... Perhaps you and I could do such things together, eh?~ [BD59496]
@59497 = ~You and I... You want—HAHAHAHAHAAA! Oh, Voghiln, that is great. You had me going there a second, you know that? You really had me going.~ [BD59497]
