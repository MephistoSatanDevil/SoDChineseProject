I should talk to people around camp and ask about the candle, potion bottle, and page of runes.

Safana came to me after picking some pockets around camp. One of her victims was carrying a notebook filled with sensitive information, meaning we might have a spy in camp. I need to investigate and find out who the traitor is. All I have to go on is the other items Safana stole.

One item is a potion bottle with an unusual shape. It might have been purchased in camp. Another item is a heavy candle with a gold leaf design on it. It looks like it might have religious significance. The last item is a page of unusual runes.~

Wait outside Dragonspear until <PRO_HESHE> passes by, then make your move. Be careful; <PRO_HESHE> is more powerful than you might expect. Subdue and capture <PRO_HIMHER> and return to the castle.

@58704 = ~Troll Breakout

I've successfully wrangled the troll.

Looks like I can add "troll wrangler" to my list of accomplishments. The crusade seems to be using the trolls as expendable muscle. I fear that will make the coming battle more difficult for the coalition.~
@58705 = ~Troll Breakout

I slew the troll the crusaders were trying to shackle.

Sindret wanted me to shackle the troll, but I killed it instead. The crusade seems to be using the trolls as expendable muscle—one fewer to deal with makes things easier for our side, even if Sindret's furious.~
@58706 = ~I know you well, child of Candlekeep, ward of Gorion. He bid me and my husband watch over you. I am Jaheira.~
@58707 = ~Forgive me. In the heat of the moment, I didn't recognize you.~
@58708 = ~Jaheira, yes—Gorion spoke of you. What brings you here? ~

@58711 = ~Tomb Key~
@58712 = ~An old key covered in rust, designed in a fashion similar to many doors in the tomb where it was found. It likely opens one or more of the tomb's doors... but if the doors' locks are the same condition as the key, that may no longer be the case.

@58713 = ~The Trial~
@58714 = ~The Trial

I should talk to Valis, Corinth, and other crusaders around the camp to determine if Corinth betrayed the crusade.

I seem to have gotten myself embroiled in a bit of intrigue in the crusaders' camp. One ranger, Valis, accuses another, Corinth, of betrayal. It falls to me to determine the truth of the matter. I should talk to Valis and Corinth as well as crusaders Ravoc, Damarr, and Delton.~
@58715 = ~The Trial 

I've finished with this pack of crusaders and their trial.

I found myself embroiled in some intrigue in the crusader camp. One ranger accused another of betrayal. I convinced their commander to resolve the issue via trial by combat. Now there's one less crusader between me and their Shining Lady.~
@58716 = ~The Trial

I should continue to investigate Corinth's actions, then return to Leopas when I have the truth.

The ranger Valis seems utterly convinced that her fellow crusader, Corinth, betrayed the cause. She has no hard evidence that I'm aware of, but she argues her case with such passion that she may not need any.~
@58717 = ~The Trial

I should continue to investigate Corinth's actions, then return to Leopas when I have the truth.

I had a conversation, if you could call it that, with the orc barbarian Ravoc regarding Valis's accusations against her fellow ranger, Corinth. He doesn't believe Corinth is guilty, if only because he thinks the man is a coward.~
@58718 = ~The Trial

A gnome suggested I speak to Leopas about someone named Corinth.~
@58719 = ~The Trial

I discussed the matter of Valis's accusations against Corinth with the gnome wizard Delton. He was rather insistent that Corinth is innocent.~
@58720 = ~The Trial

I should continue to investigate Corinth's actions, then return to Leopas when I have the truth.

I have spoken with the crusader Damarr regarding Corinth's alleged actions at Innisfall. While she has few doubts that he did what Valis accuses him of, she feels the punishment a guilty verdict will inevitably bring outweighs the severity of the crime.~
@58721 = ~The Trial

I've finished with this pack of crusaders and their trial.

The conflict 'twixt the crusaders Valis and Corinth has been resolved. I do not know if I did the right thing. I hope I did.~
@58722 = ~The Trial

I've finished with this pack of crusaders and their trial.

The conflict 'twixt the crusaders Valis and Corinth has been resolved. Did I do the right thing? In truth, I care little. Though I took some enjoyment from playing the role of one, ultimately, crusaders are my enemies.~
@58723 = ~The Trial

I've finished with this pack of crusaders and their trial.

The conflict 'twixt the crusaders Valis and Corinth has been resolved. I took no little pleasure in pitting the fools one against the other.~
