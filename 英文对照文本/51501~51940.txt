@51501 = ~That's good to hear.~
@51502 = ~Maybe we're not praying hard enough?~
@51503 = ~Mighty Foehammer! Hear our cries!~
@51504 = ~I don't understand.~
@51505 = ~Praise be to Tempus!~
@51506 = ~I don't feel any different.~
@51507 = ~This isn't working.~
@51508 = ~I thought I would feel something... a sense of rightness or peace.~
@51509 = ~I thought the Foehammer would acknowledge our efforts in SOME way.~
@51510 = ~Ah! Oh, hello. You startled me. Is there something we can do for you?~
@51511 = ~What are you doing?~
@51512 = ~Are you praying to a rock?~
@51513 = ~I doubt it. You appear busy.~
@51514 = ~We found this stone in the ruins around here. Tempus's symbol is engraved on it. Since he's the god of battle, we're praying for his aid.~
@51515 = ~I'd have thought Caelar's holiness and our crusade's cause would ensure Tempus's blessing. But so far, we've felt nothing.~
@51516 = ~The will of gods isn't always obvious. I'm certain the Lord of Battles heard your plea.~
@51517 = ~Maybe Tempus is really, really busy at the moment? There's a lot of war going around these days.~
@51518 = ~The gods have more important things to do than listen to your drivel.~
@51519 = ~No, no, you're wrong! The gods care for their worshippers. We matter to them!~
@51520 = ~We weren't expecting a voice from the heavens, but SOME sense of grace or comfort isn't too much to ask, is it? Why would Tempus ignore Caelar's righteous warriors?~
@51521 = ~Perhaps Caelar is not so holy as she seems. Why else would Tempus ignore your prayers?~
@51522 = ~Gods, right? What can you do?~
@51523 = ~I'll leave you to your attempts, then.~
@51524 = ~Gods do not always scream in the faithful ear. Sometimes they whisper.~ [BD51524]
@51525 = ~When my patron speaks to me, I feel his voice in the marrow of my bones.~
@51526 = ~Gods do not always scream in their faithfuls' ears. Sometimes they whisper.~ [BD51526]
@51527 = ~Oo, I hate it when they do that. It tickles.~ [BD51527]
@51528 = ~No true crusader would speak of Caelar that way!~
@51529 = ~Wait! Perhaps you can help us catch Tempus's ear.~
@51530 = ~This icon is very old. See the cracks here? Two chunks of the stone have fallen out. Could that be the problem?~
@51531 = ~If you could find the two shards, maybe we could reconstruct the icon and Tempus would finally respond!~
@51532 = ~I see no harm in trying it. Do you have any idea where the shards might be?~
@51533 = ~Stranger things have happened. If I find the shards, I'll return to you.~
@51534 = ~I've no interest in encouraging your pathetic endeavor.~
@51535 = ~Thank you! We found the icon in that rubble to the north, but fragments could be anywhere in camp—check any of the rubble you come across. I saw Morale Officer Deneld walking through the area too. He might have seen something.~
@51536 = ~Ideally the shards would be blessed by a priest of Tempus, but I don't suppose you can help with that. Farewell, and good luck to you.~
@51537 = ~Hello, recruit. You must be new. ~
@51538 = ~New, but already working hard. I'm searching for a stone shard about so big.~
@51539 = ~Yes, I just joined a short time ago.~
@51540 = ~What gave me away?~
@51541 = ~New to Caelar's service, yes, but I'm not without experience in the ways of war.~
@51542 = ~A stone shard? Whatever for? ~
@51543 = ~I'm trying to restore a stone icon of Tempus.~
@51544 = ~It's classified. A special mission from one of the high-ups.~
@51545 = ~None of your business.~
@51546 = ~Really? Intriguing... Yes, now that you mention it, I believe I did happen upon the shard you seek. Here it is—I trust you will let those who assigned you this mission know of my cooperation? Good fortune to you for its successful completion.~
@51547 = ~Watch yourself—I'll not stand for insubordination. I suppose you're trying to reconstruct that icon I saw those other recruits messing around with.~
@51548 = ~I don't approve of recruits trying to directly curry the gods' favor. Caelar is our spiritual leader.~
@51549 = ~Faerûn is a land of many gods. More divine power supporting us can only be a good thing. Surely you can see that.~
@51550 = ~I am a holy <PRO_MANWOMAN>. I understand your devotion to Caelar, but only a fool turns their back on the gods.~
@51551 = ~Tempus is a god of strength. It's best for all of us if to curry his favor however we can.~
@51552 = ~I understand your doubts, but we need recruit morale to stay high. Trust me, no harm will come from giving me the shard.~
@51553 = ~There's something to what you say, I can't deny it. Here, take the shard and go forth to do the Shining Lady's work.~
@51554 = ~I think not. The shard stays in my pocket.~
@51555 = ~Explain your reasoning again?~
@51556 = ~Goodbye, then.~
@51557 = ~Go forth, for the crusade! ~
@51558 = ~Tempus, the lord of strength at arms and military might, will lead us to victory! ~
@51559 = ~I have a question for you. If I had pieces from a broken holy symbol of Tempus, could you bless them before I repair the icon?~
@51560 = ~I'm sure he will. Do you have any healing or potions for sale?~
@51561 = ~I need to go.~
@51562 = ~I COULD, yes. Where is this icon? I would like to look upon it. ~
@51563 = ~I'm afraid it's in the crusader camp. I've been posing as a recruit there.~
@51564 = ~That would be a bad idea. The crusaders have it.~
@51565 = ~It's out of our reach right now.~
@51566 = ~A shame. To answer your question, yes, I could bless the broken pieces to help make the icon whole again. ~
@51567 = ~Wait, you're not mad that the crusaders are praying to Tempus? No blistering invectives?~
@51568 = ~You took that a lot better than I'd feared.~
@51569 = ~I have the pieces here.~
@51570 = ~I'll return when I have the pieces, then.~
@51571 = ~A shame. To answer your question, yes, I could bless the broken pieces to help make the icon whole again. ~
@51572 = ~Tempus is a god of courage and of battle. He is not concerned with philosophical differences, only might. It's no surprise the crusaders would turn to him.~
@51573 = ~That makes sense. I have the pieces here.~
@51574 = ~The gods never fail to surprise me. Here are the pieces.~
@51575 = ~Bide a moment while I call down the glory of Foehammer.~
@51576 = ~There. The pieces are sanctified, the icon restored. I thank you for your service to the Lord of Battles.~
@51577 = ~Do so! I look forward to blessing them in Tempus's name.~
@51578 = ~YOU HAVE RESTORED THE ICON OF TEMPUS. THE LORD OF BATTLES LOOKS UPON YOU. ~ [BD51578]
@51579 = ~I am humbled before Tempus.~
@51580 = ~Don't thank me. It was really these two here, Kjarvan and Qing, that did the work.~
@51581 = ~I stand proudly before the god's eye.~
@51582 = ~Tempus has heard our prayers!~
@51583 = ~YOU STAND AT THE DAWN OF BATTLE. DO YOU BELIEVE YOU SHALL PREVAIL?~ [BD51583]
@51584 = ~My side will DEFINITELY prevail.~
@51585 = ~I cannot say. Success depends on many factors—the will of the gods among them.~
@51586 = ~Any force blessed with my support will stand victorious. Of this there is no doubt.~
@51587 = ~Bless us, mighty Tempus!~
@51588 = ~ASK AND YOU SHALL BE TESTED. CLAIM VICTORY AND TEMPUS WILL DELIVER HIS AID.~ [BD51588]
@51589 = ~I would like to be tested.~
@51590 = ~Tested? Tested how, exactly?~
@51591 = ~I don't want to be tested.~
@51592 = ~TRIAL BY COMBAT. IT IS THE WAY OF TEMPUS. ~ [BD51592]
@51593 = ~SO BE IT.~ [BD51593]
@51594 = ~To be tested by Tempus is an honor!~
@51595 = ~PREPARE YOURSELF FOR THE FOEHAMMER'S CHALLENGE.~ [BD51595]
@51596 = ~Tempus thanks you! ~
@51597 = ~I found the two stone shards.~
@51598 = ~The shards have been blessed by a priest of Tempus.~
@51599 = ~And I thank Tempus.~
@51600 = ~Wonderful! I only wish we could get the shards blessed. There's no priests of Tempus in the camp.~
@51601 = ~At least we can restore the icon. Come, it's over here next to the tent.~
@51602 = ~Truly? How did you manage that?~
@51603 = ~I heard of a priest of Tempus in the camp to the south.~
@51604 = ~I met a priest wandering in the wild, and convinced her to bless the shards.~
@51605 = ~Does it matter? The shards are now consecrated.~
@51606 = ~You were in the enemy camp? You're no crusader... ~
@51607 = ~This is exciting news. Quickly, place the consecrated shards where they belong! The icon is there next to that tent.~
@51608 = ~We appreciate your help. All the best to you.~
@51609 = ~You find chief? You bring my Slug back?~
@51610 = ~Not yet. I'll keep looking.~
@51611 = ~I did find him. I'm sorry, Murs. The shiners killed Slug and the other ogres.~
@51612 = ~Your mate made a fatal mistake in crossing me. I slew him.~
@51613 = ~You go find him now. Now! Please?~
@51614 = ~Slug! NO! How can this be? How can I go on without your hairy arms to hold me?~
@51615 = ~He died bravely, fighting his enemies with everything he had.~
@51616 = ~He was exceptionally hairy, even for an ogre.~
@51617 = ~Dry your tears, woman. They'll not bring him back.~
@51618 = ~At least I know what happen to him. Here, take this. It Slug's once. Yours now.~
@51619 = ~But you supposed to find Slug—bring him back to me! Useless! I KILL YOU!~
@51620 = ~The hero comes back!~
@51621 = ~Well met, Slug and Murs.~
@51622 = ~I do indeed. I take it from your welcome that all is well?~
@51623 = ~I've come for my payment.~
@51624 = ~Slug chief again! Soon we go back to caves, do what we do best. Smash heads and take gold!~ [BD51624]
@51625 = ~That's... that's great, Slug. Maybe just try and limit the smashing to crusader heads, yes?~
@51626 = ~Please, don't. Think of your mistreatment at the crusade's hands—would you truly make others victims, as Caelar's servants made you one?~
@51627 = ~You and I are remarkably alike, friend Slug.~
@51628 = ~Thou art most certainly wise. We cannot let these brigands rampage over the land.~ [BD51628]
@51629 = ~Me keep Slug safe. No more fighting shiners for us, Slug!~
@51630 = ~Sigh. Yes, Murs.~
@51631 = ~You save me and I see Murs again. Murs say me give you prize as thanks. Belong to my family many years. Still don't know what it does. Something magic. Maybe you figure out.~
@51632 = ~Thank you, Slug. Farewell to you both.~
@51633 = ~That's quite the pedigree. I'll treasure it.~
@51634 = ~It will do.~
@51635 = ~You have friend now, <PRO_RACE>. Vaprak watch over you like ogre. It good thing.~
@51636 = ~That's far enough, <PRO_RACE>. ~ [BD51636]
@51637 = ~I am <CHARNAME>, hero of Baldur's Gate. I have business with the crusade.~
@51638 = ~You think to command a member of Caelar's holy crusade? I should take your head for this indignity!~
@51639 = ~I'm sorry?~
@51640 = ~This far I'll go, then, and no further.~
@51641 = ~I would go farther. Do not try to stop me.~
@51642 = ~All right. Short of me killing you all horribly, what would it take for you to let me go on my way?~
@51643 = ~All who would pass must pay the toll.~
@51644 = ~All who would pass must pay the toll.~
@51645 = ~Shut it, Raggemos! I'm takin' care o'this! You, <CHARNAME>. You wanna pass, you gotta pay the toll.~ [BD51645]
@51646 = ~How much is this toll?~
@51647 = ~You walk on dangerous ground, hobgoblin. I am a servant of Caelar Argent. See here, I have her seal.~
@51648 = ~Then I guess I'll pass somewhere else.~
@51649 = ~Get out of my way or you'll pay a toll most dear, I promise you that.~
@51650 = ~Not yetcher not. But that could change.~
@51651 = ~Looka that, Battuks! They got one of'r sisters with'm!~
@51652 = ~All who would pass by here must pay the toll.~
@51653 = ~According to who?~
@51654 = ~I see. I'll just go back the way I came, then.~
@51655 = ~Get out of my way or you'll pay a toll most dear, I promise you that.~
@51656 = ~Wait—you don't wanna fight? ~
@51657 = ~Not particularly, no. If this is as far as we can go, so be it.~
@51658 = ~I don't want to fight you. I mean, look at you. It wouldn't be MUCH of a fight, would it?~
@51659 = ~Fight? No. Drench the ground in the blood of idiot goblins? Yes. Oh yes.~
@51660 = ~They don't wanna fight, Battuks! What're we gonna do?~
@51661 = ~They don't wanna fight, they gotta pay.~
@51662 = ~Pay?~
@51663 = ~Careful, hobgoblin. Not wanting to fight is not the same as being unwilling to fight.~
@51664 = ~Pay you? I think not. The most you'll get from me is a quick death. Stand aside, or suffer the consequences.~
@51665 = ~You don't gotta pay the toll if ye're crusade. You crusade?~
@51666 = ~I'd sooner pay the toll than shed your blood, hobgoblin. How much will this cost me?~
@51667 = ~Of course! What in the hells would I be doing in this godsforsaken place if I weren't with the crusade?~
@51668 = ~If it makes you feel better, sure, I'm with the crusade.~
@51669 = ~I'm on a crusade, of a sort. But mine is much different than Caelar's.~
@51670 = ~Aye, awright. Be on yer way.~
@51671 = ~Stupid Softbelcher! You let them pass without paying the toll?~
@51672 = ~Look at <PRO_HIMHER>, Raggemos! What're we gonna do to someone like that? Nothin'. An' we'd shed blood and break our bones doin' it.~
@51673 = ~Fah! Coward! You think the crusade will treat us better if we don't do our job? Fool, you are! Fool!~
@51674 = ~We speak for the Shining Lady, Caelar. She bid us mind these paths and collect the toll.~
@51675 = ~I find that hard to believe.~
@51676 = ~I also serve the will of Caelar. Look, I've got her seal right here.~
@51677 = ~The crusade must be in dire straits indeed, using scum like you to enforce the Shining Lady's will.~
@51678 = ~No, no, 's true. We work for the Lady.~
@51679 = ~It says it's with the crusade, Battuks.~
@51680 = ~Shut it, Sickly! I'll take care o'this. So you're with the Lady, eh?~
@51681 = ~You doubt it? Here, I have her seal.~
@51682 = ~I don't think it would be lying to say I have a part in Caelar's plans.~
@51683 = ~You could put it that way. I wouldn't, because I value accuracy, but if it'll spare me a toll or a fight, feel free.~
@51684 = ~I'm not with her yet, but I eagerly await the moment I am.~
@51685 = ~So y'do, so y'do. Awright then. You c'n pass.~
@51686 = ~Stupid Softbelcher! You let them pass without paying the toll?~
@51687 = ~They was with th'crusade, Ghostrant. I did what I hadda.~
@51688 = ~Awright then. Off you go.~
@51689 = ~Your snake words won't get you past us, <PRO_RACE>. You're paying the toll, with gold or your life.~
@51690 = ~50 gold.~
@51691 = ~Be silent, Sickly! Yer betters're talking. Ignore the boy. Toll's 50 gold a head.~
@51692 = ~Very well.~
@51693 = ~That seems an onerous burden, considering.~
@51694 = ~I'm not paying that. I guess I'll be going back the way I came, then.~
@51695 = ~I have a counter-offer: Give me 50 gold, and I'll leave you YOUR head.~
@51696 = ~Awright. Be off with you, then.~
@51697 = ~Good, Battuks. You did good.~
@51698 = ~They isn't gonna pay! Get'm!~
@51699 = ~What? We ain't payin' you!~
@51700 = ~That is unfortunate. For you.~
@51701 = ~We seem to have reached an impasse. What do you suggest we do here?~
@51702 = ~Oh, you'll pay, goblin. One way or another.~
@51703 = ~Less jus' call it even, hey? You be on yer way, we'll be on ours. ~
@51704 = ~Agreed.~
@51705 = ~I'm afraid it's too late for that. At this point, I can accept nothing less than your bloody demise. You may throw yourself on your own blade, or, if you prefer, I can kill you myself. Which will it be?~
@51706 = ~Your way came to an end the moment you crossed me, goblin.~
@51707 = ~Awright. Off with yez, then.~
@51708 = ~Get'm!~
@51709 = ~Run away! Run!~
@51710 = ~Don't wanna die!~
@51711 = ~Come back here, y'cowards! Come back!~
@51712 = ~So they do. This won't stand. Release the female, <PRO_RACE>, or pay the price. ~
@51713 = ~M'Khiin is no prisoner of mine—she is free to do as she wishes. I doubt she'll go willingly with you.~
@51714 = ~Let's talk prices. How much will it cost for us to pass through here without someone getting hurt?~
@51715 = ~Her mind is her own—she is free to do as she wishes. Whether she's with me or not, I doubt she'll willingly go with you.~
@51716 = ~M'Khiin stays with me. Isn't that right, M'Khiin?~
@51717 = ~Release her? Very well, then. M'Khiin, you are released. Go, be with your people.~
@51718 = ~Back away or SOMEONE will pay a price.~
@51719 = ~She don't need t'be willing.~
@51720 = ~Charming...~ [BD51720]
@51721 = ~Goblins should be with goblins.~
@51722 = ~He's not wrong.~ [BD51722]
@51723 = ~I wonder, do you feel the same way about drow, Captain?~ [BD51723]
@51724 = ~I'd be happy to discuss the matter some other time.~ [BD51724]
@51725 = ~I'm not going with you wormbellies. Get away from here.~ [BD51725]
@51726 = ~Ho, she got a knife where her tongue should be. Mind your mouth, little sister. We'll getcha out of this.~ [BD51726]
@51727 = ~Stand aside, hobgoblin. I'll not warn you again.~
@51728 = ~Hobgoblins are supposed to be smart, yes? I advise you to consider your next move VERY carefully.~
@51729 = ~There's nothing to get her out of, you idiot! She chose to travel with me.~
@51730 = ~How terribly noble of you. A question, though: If you're going to "rescue" M'Khiin, who will save you?~
@51731 = ~Better you than this lot.~
@51732 = ~Not exactly the highest bar to clear, that, is it?~
@51733 = ~We're wasting time. A slaughter is inevitable—let it begin sooner than later.~
@51734 = ~Can't do it. Not while you got one of ours.~
@51735 = ~I don't belong to you.~
@51736 = ~Silence! Your betters speak.~
@51737 = ~You think yourself better than M'Khiin? Wrong. So wrong.~
@51738 = ~Her "betters" would do well to stop speaking and start thinking.~
@51739 = ~Not for much longer, they don't.~
@51740 = ~Get out, you dirtlickers! Run while you still can!~ [BD51740]

@51744 = ~50 gold a head. And the goblin, we're not leaving one of'r own.~
@51745 = ~Then I'm afraid we have a problem.~
@51746 = ~Then we've got a problem. Or, more accurately, you've got a problem.~
@51747 = ~I'll give you the gold, but M'Khiin is her own person. She can stay with me or not as she pleases.~
@51748 = ~Very well. M'Khiin, go with them.~
@51749 = ~I see no problem here. No problem at all.~
@51750 = ~Aye, I guess we do at that. GET THEM!~
@51751 = ~No more talk! Kill the <PRO_RACE>! KILL IT!~
@51752 = ~She's a goblin. She should be with her own kind.~

@51756 = ~Not going. Won't do it.~ [BD51756]
@51757 = ~I... thank you, <CHARNAME>. Not many <PRO_RACE>s would shed blood over a goblin.~ [BD51757]
@51758 = ~Too few. But I have faith that will change in time.~
@51759 = ~We are not defined by race, M'Khiin—or we shouldn't be, at least. It's what one does that truly matters.~
@51760 = ~You'd have done the same, were our positions reversed.~
@51761 = ~You need no one to stand up for you, goblin. From the moment they crossed you, those fools' death was inevitable.~
@51762 = ~You stood up for me. I won't forget it.~ [BD51762]
@51763 = ~Maybe. Don't know if I believe it. More likely now, anyway. You stood up for me. Won't forget it.~ [BD51763]

@51775 = ~Svirfneblin, actually. And what I want is to show you the benefits of a well-stocked potion bandolier!~ [BD51775]

@51801 = ~You seem intelligent enough. You'll figure it out eventually.~
@51802 = ~Bloody hells. I already regret restoring you. Go, get out of here, or I'll send you back to the other side for what I promise will be the last time.~
@51803 = ~I was making my way to the depot when I was attacked by two sawa—sahwawg—by two fishmen. They toyed with me awhile—a long while. Then they tired of me and left me to die.~
@51804 = ~Fortunately for me, Caelar's light shines strong in even the darkest places. You brought me back, and for that, I thank you.~
@51805 = ~You are very welcome.~
@51806 = ~Think nothing of it. Though if you ever have a child, consider naming it <CHARNAME>.~
@51807 = ~Caelar had nothing to do with it.~
@51808 = ~I'd best continue on to the depot. The sah—the fishmen are nothing compared to my commander. She won't care about me dying, I'll still take a hiding for this. Thanks again, and farewell.~
@51809 = ~I... see. Well, I'd best continue on to the depot. The sah—the fishmen are nothing compared to my commander. She won't care about me dying, I'll still take a hiding for this. Thanks again, and farewell.~
@51810 = ~Yes, <PRO_SIRMAAM>. Very good, <PRO_SIRMAAM>.~
@51811 = ~Uxley had enough of the sahuagin—I think it was Uxley. Might've been Orland, though that's not really like him. Sorry, things are still a little... jumbled. Anyway. We attacked. You see the result.~
@51812 = ~I need to report this incident. Gods, Ladle's not going to be happy about this... But that's my problem. Thanks again. Farewell.~
@51813 = ~I... see. Well. I need to report this incident. Gods, Ladle's not going to be happy about this... But that's my problem. Thanks again. Farewell.~
@51814 = ~Looks like we're here. Place the barrel—quickly.~ [BD51814]
@51815 = ~Is anyone else surprised the barrel didn't actually explode on the way here? No? That's just me?~ [BD51815]
@51816 = ~It was thee and thee alone. Our allies do not want to risk our lives.~ [BD51816]
@51817 = ~Have you actually MET our allies...?~ [BD51817]
@51818 = ~Go 'way, <PRO_RACE>. Me no talk with you.~
@51819 = ~Who are you?~
@51820 = ~What are you doing here?~
@51821 = ~I feel much the same about you, ogre. Enjoy your captivity.~
@51822 = ~*BELLLCH*~
@51823 = ~Why you care? You out of cage, we in cage.~
@51824 = ~Humor me. Who are you?~
@51825 = ~How'd you get caged?~
@51826 = ~Good point. I should be going.~
@51827 = ~What you care? You out of cage, we in cage. Eh. Whatever. Me Slug, leader of ogre band. We live in caves. Go outside caves, take what we need, kill who's we want. It good life.~ [BD51827]
@51828 = ~You're Slug? Murs's mate?~
@51829 = ~Despicable. You earned this cage.~
@51830 = ~Sounds like it.~
@51831 = ~You may stop talking now. Farewell, ogre. We'll not meet again.~
@51832 = ~It'll take more than high-minded words to stir this beast's conscience, <CHARNAME>.~ [BD51832]
@51833 = ~Slug best bandit in forest! Make lots of gold, have strong mate. Then shiners come. Chase us out of tunnels. Kill some. Catch us.~
@51834 = ~You say your name is Slug? Is your mate Murs, by any chance?~
@51835 = ~A tragic and all too common tale, these days. Perhaps we can be of assistance to each other.~
@51836 = ~You used to live in these tunnels, eh? Perhaps you can help me out.~
@51837 = ~The best bandit in the High Moor, trapped in a crusader cage? Pathetic. Luck to you, ogre. You'll need it.~
@51838 = ~What you mean? ~
@51839 = ~If I freed you, could you offer some guidance through the tunnels you once called home?~
@51840 = ~You're inside a cage; I'm outside the cage. I could let you out—for the right price.~
@51841 = ~I must have been mad to think a creature such as you could possibly help me. Fare thee well, ogre.~
@51842 = ~Why Slug trust <PRO_RACE>? Your kind put me here. Small races mean and tricky.~
@51843 = ~That is all too often true, regrettably. But we share the same desire—the crusade's destruction. Surely we can work together against a common foe?~
@51844 = ~You don't want to get back at the crusade? They killed your people and took what was yours. I can help you get revenge.~
@51845 = ~You call me small? Look, look at my muscles! I will slay the crusaders who put you here, count on it. The only question is what you'll be doing when it happens.~
@51846 = ~You think I'm small? Bugger you, then. You're on your own.~
@51847 = ~Perhaps a spell to strengthen you and your allies would prove my good intentions?~
@51848 = ~Allow me to demonstrate my good intentions by healing you and your allies.~
@51849 = ~I assure you, I only want to stop the crusade. You can trust me.~
@51850 = ~You can stay in there and rot or you can accept my help. Do you want out or not?~
@51851 = ~I offered you my hand and you slap it away. So be it. Enjoy captivity, ogre, as I shall enjoy liberty.~
@51852 = ~Yeah they do! Stupid humans.~
@51853 = ~Let ogres out first. THEN Slug help you.~
@51854 = ~Slug help you—AFTER you let ogres out.~
@51855 = ~You know Murs?~
@51856 = ~Yes. I met her at a camp near the cavern entrance. I was able to help her.~
@51857 = ~She's about eight feet tall, bald, built like a brick outhouse? Oh yes, I know her.~
@51858 = ~I met your mate. She was trying to take control of what remains of your band.~
@51859 = ~How Murs doing? She all right?~
@51860 = ~She was in the end. I slew Arbinge and Cheski, allowing her to take control of your band of malcontents—what remains of it, at least.~
@51861 = ~She wasn't happy when I killed Arbinge and Cheski and assumed control of your motley crew. But we parted on agreeable terms.~
@51862 = ~Let's just say I helped her out of a difficult situation.~
@51863 = ~If Murs trust you, Slug trust you. Let us out, we help!~
@51864 = ~Slug free! ~ [BD51864]
@51865 = ~You are indeed, friend ogre. ~
@51866 = ~Now that you're free, how can you help me?~
@51867 = ~Fulfil your promise now and assist me.~
@51868 = ~Murs is all alone at brigand camp. Slug needs to find her. But first Slug help you.~
@51869 = ~Murs all alone outside. Slug need find her, but first help you. In north end of river caverns is fresh water—good to drink. On wall next to pool is hiding hole. Ogre treasure there. It will help you kill shiners!~ [BD51869]
@51870 = ~You have my thanks, ogre.~
@51871 = ~Good treasure, I hope.~
@51872 = ~You'd better not be lying.~
@51873 = ~Now Slug go use secret passage—get past shiner guards. Kill 'em if they get in way. Find Murs and then we kill shiners, every one we can. They take Slug away from Murs. Slug take heads away from bodies.~
@51874 = ~Ha ha! Slug trick you! No trust little races. You stay and fight shiners. We go.~
@51875 = ~Damn me for a fool—I should have known better than to trust a creature such as you.~
@51876 = ~I suppose that's what I get for putting my faith in an ogre brigand...~
@51877 = ~You'll pay dearly for your treachery, ogre—NOW.~
@51878 = ~Minsc believes in giving benefit of the doubt, but even he thinks twice about trusting ogres. Thrice, if there is time for that much thinking.~ [BD51878]
@51879 = ~Ogres follow Slug! We go find Murs!~
@51880 = ~Slug squish you!~
@51881 = ~Intruders! Die die!~
@51882 = ~Water mephit!~ [BD51882]
@51883 = ~DEAD water mephit!~
@51884 = ~Poor creature. You never had a chance.~
@51885 = ~No more a chance than it would have given us. Do not mourn this beast, goblin.~
@51886 = ~Three bodies lie on the altar. A band of light skin on the old woman's finger marks the place a ring was once worn. A short sword's sheathe hangs at the man's side, empty.~
@51887 = ~Is there anything I can do to help?~
@51888 = ~Goodbye, then.~
@51889 = ~Ymori's Body~
@51890 = ~You return. Isabella? We have company...~ [BD51890]
@51891 = ~Hello? I thought I heard something.~ [BD51891]
@51892 = ~The stone altar's surface has sufficient room for three bodies.~
@51893 = ~Coalition Sentry~
@51894 = ~I'm practicing what you told me. Acknowledge. Adapt. It... it sometimes works. Excuse me, I have to focus.~
@51895 = ~Fear breeds weakness. Acknowledge your fear. Accept it, but do not succumb to it. You must be stronger than the darkness.~
@51896 = ~Ah, aha. It's you again. G-good to see you.~
@51897 = ~How are you, Elandro?~
@51898 = ~I'm only passing by. Take care.~
@51899 = ~Well enough. I'm remembering what you told me. Accept... adapt... and so forth. I think it's helping.~
@51900 = ~How do you think I am? I just hope if another one of those things appears, the guards are ready for it.~
@51901 = ~Pass by this way anytime. I could use the company. You never know what might pop out of thin air...~
@51902 = ~I thought I heard something...~
@51903 = ~What in all the Hells is THAT?~
@51904 = ~Daggerford Scout~
@51905 = ~Yes, I have one here.~
@51906 = ~I have learned much during our time together, <CHARNAME>.~
@51907 = ~Are you sure you want to do that, Dynaheir?~
@51908 = ~You would leave now? But things are finally to the point where we might see some good come of our time together, rather than endless violence and bloodshed.~
@51909 = ~If that is your wish.~
@51910 = ~I have learned much during our time together. It is past time I communicated that knowledge to my sisters.~
@51911 = ~The friendship of Minsc and Boo travels with you.~ [BD51911]
@51912 = ~My brother's death has left me with little stomach for violence.~ [BD51912]
@51913 = ~Take care, "hero" of Baldur's Gate. You are not like these others.~ [BD51913]
@51914 = ~I'm going now, <CHARNAME>.~ [BD51914]
@51915 = ~What? Why?~
@51916 = ~You can't leave now, Safana. Things are just about to get good.~
@51917 = ~Begone, then. If you've no use for me, I've certainly none for you.~
@51918 = ~It's a personal matter between me and a man in a green mask. Farewell.~ [BD51918]
@51919 = ~Alas, they'll not be nearly as good without me there to share them. But such is life—I must go.~ [BD51919]
@51920 = ~Don't be that way, <CHARNAME>. This has nothing to do with you.~ [BD51920]
@51921 = ~I foresee great tedium in your future. I do not care for it.~ [BD51921]
@51922 = ~Now that the servants of Sarevok have finally been eliminated, we can spend more time together, Khalid.~
@51923 = ~That s-sounds wonderful.~
@51924 = ~We've an invitation from our... friends in the north. We should go there as soon as we're able.~
@51925 = ~We w-will depart on the morrow.~
@51926 = ~You're leaving?~
@51927 = ~I guess this is goodbye, then.~
@51928 = ~Why wait? If you're so anxious to leave, then begone.~
@51929 = ~We have responsibilities to others as well as to you. And those others call us north.~
@51930 = ~You have more than earned it, my friends.~
@51931 = ~I understand.~
@51932 = ~And your responsibilities to these others mean more to you than the oath you swore to my foster father?~
@51933 = ~We have sworn other oaths, and those who we swore them to require us to leave this place. You are safe here in Baldur's Gate. Gorion would be satisfied with this, even if you are not.~
@51934 = ~F-farewell, <CHARNAME>.~
@51935 = ~For now, at least. We will meet again, I am sure of it.~
@51936 = ~You are as gracious as a porcupine.~
@51937 = ~We shall meet again, <CHARNAME>. I am certain of it.~
@51938 = ~And now we shall be together alone. If you can't understand the appeal of that, there's nothing to be done with you. Take care.~
@51939 = ~The time has come for us to part, <CHARNAME>. My patron calls upon me to head north. I would do well not to press my luck with him.~ [BD51939]
@51940 = ~I need a break, <CHARNAME>. All this dungeon... eering—it's wearing me down.~
