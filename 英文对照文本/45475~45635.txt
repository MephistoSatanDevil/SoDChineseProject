@45569 = ~You were raised in Candlekeep, you say? Tell me more.~
@45570 = ~It was a quiet, peaceful childhood. I learned a great deal and always felt safe.~

@45573 = ~And did the monks there raise you?~
@45574 = ~No, my mentor, Gorion, did that. I had other friends, but he was the closest I ever had to a family. Sarevok Anchev killed him.~
@45575 = ~No. A man named Gorion did that. He was murdered just as I left Candlekeep. In the end, I avenged him.~
@45576 = ~The monks couldn't raise their heads from whatever book absorbed their attention at any given moment. A man named Gorion cared for me. He was murdered for the trouble. After that, I went my own way.~

@45581 = ~That's very dramatic, yes. Thank you for telling me your story. I could use your help for certain, m'dear. ~
@45582 = ~Very dramatic, yes. Erm, I could use some advice. I wish to visit Candlekeep and view a Netherese tome—there are secret writings upon its pages my potion will reveal. But I lack a book of great value with which to gain entry.~
@45583 = ~How can I help?~
@45584 = ~Yeah, the gatekeeper is really determined not to let anyone in without a book.~
@45585 = ~Get to the point.~
@45586 = ~It seems to me that enhancing an existing volume by revealing hidden text is almost like giving them a book, yes? Do you think such an argument would carry water with the gatekeepers?~
@45587 = ~I'm not sure it will work, but you can try.~
@45588 = ~That's a tricky needle to thread. The guards are not renowned for flexibility in interpreting the rules.~
@45589 = ~That will never work.~
@45590 = ~I know my chances are slim, but a letter from you endorsing my offer might help. As it happens, I've a draft of just such a letter here—I was hoping Grand Duke Jannath might sign it, but a <PRO_SONDAUGHTER> of Candlekeep would surely have greater influence.~
@45591 = ~Certainly I'll sign your letter. Here you go.~
@45592 = ~I'm not entirely comfortable with that...~
@45593 = ~You would have me risk my good name on your account? Think again, old woman.~
@45594 = ~Oh, thank you, thank you! I'll leave for Candlekeep at once. Here, take this as a small token of my appreciation.~
@45595 = ~The letter makes no claims on your behalf. Your reputation won't be in danger of any harm—it simply explains the situation. Won't you help me?~
@45596 = ~Very well. Here you are.~
@45597 = ~The gatekeeper will judge your argument on its merits. My signature, or anyone else's, for that matter, will not sway him one way or the other.~
@45598 = ~Fair enough. I had to ask, you understand, yes? Well, I'm off to Candlekeep regardless. Here's a little reward for your help with the moss.~

"My triumph is at hand. Daeros Dragonspear lies dead. Halatathlaer fell to the might of my one-time draconic allies, who cannot have been pleased to learn that I snatched Halatathlaer's treasures out from under them. Her gold, gems, and items of all sorts are mine now, but more than that, I found her clutch. The eggs are now concealed in caverns far beneath the Castle. Halatathlaer's wyrmling offspring will make perfect subjects for my necromantic experiments. I will continue to add to the series of spells that will sustain them on minimal food and water while they are prepared for their final fate. Wards throughout the cavern will prevent their escape until I return to complete the rites that will transform them into my undead servitors. If I am successful in this working, the dragons will be more than able to protect me from those who hunt me now. And should I fail—considering the intricacy of the magic involved, it is a possibility—the results will still be worthy of study."~
