@45198 = ~Mail of the Hallowed Hero +3~
@45199 = ~This armor was first worn by Olen Argent, Caelar's great-grandfather. Olen Argent's quest to hunt down a cult of Malar led him to the Misty Forest, where he encountered a group of elves living in the woods. At first, the elves were suspicious of Olen and tried to drive him out of the forest, but he spoke so eloquently of his quest that they agreed to help him. The elves tracked the cult to their hiding place within the forest, where Olen eradicated the cultists for their murderous deeds. Thankful to have the evil presence out of their homeland, the elves crafted a fine suit of mail for the paladin.

@45207 = ~These irridescent scaled boots gleam with a hundred shades of color. On a trade voyage across the Alamber Sea, a ship passed by a pitched battle between sahuagin marauders and a colony of merfolk. The ship's bard leaned over the rail and played a rousing ballad of courage. Bolstered, the merfolk overcame and drove off the vicious sahuagin. One of the mermaids swam up to the ship and handed the bard a glittering shed mermaid tail, telling him that any item fashioned from the scales would gain a valuable enchantment. The bard had the tail made into a pair of boots that have been passed on to his descendants, though their flashy nature makes the wearer quite memorable.

Finally, one night Tinny stabbed his mark in a mugging gone wrong and was shocked to see a gem fall out of the victim's wound. Tinny eagerly grabbed the gem, rejoicing in his newfound wealth. Stories of Tinny's good fortune spread quickly. A few days later, he was found stabbed to death in his bed, his dagger gone.

When pirates attacked, Montgomer threw himself into battle but promptly took a blow to the arm and lost his cutlass. Undaunted, he grabbed a belaying pin and used it bash pirate skulls. After the attack was over, Montgomer's mates praised his bravery and joked that he should always keep his "cudgel" at his side. Montgomer did so, eventually having the belaying pin enchanted with healing powers, but later traded it in for a more powerful (and wieldy) weapon.

@45220 = ~Zaviak's Vision Quest

If I wear the Spectacles of Spectacle, I can see extraplanar creatures and "pull" up to three of them into this world.

I obtained a pair of magic spectacles from the eccentric elf Zaviak. He claims I can use them to see spirits and creatures from other planes and "pull" these creatures into our world a finite number of times. I have no idea how many of these extraplanar creatures I'll see on my journey. I must think carefully before drawing one into the Prime Material Plane.~
@45221 = ~Zaviak's Vision Quest

I called forth a fire elemental in the Elfsong Tavern. 

Al-Alai, First Fury of the White Forge, attacked me. I was forced to destroy it.~

@45228 = ~Every elemental plane has its own native creatures, the lowest of which are the mephits. These imp-like creatures appear composed of whatever element dominates their home plane.

This ornate gold ring displays four chips of precious stone—emerald, ruby, sapphire, and diamond—surrounding a grinning mephit's face.

@45230 = ~Jester's Bracers~
@45231 = ~These bracers once belonged to a traveling bard famed for his sharp tongue and quick retorts. One rainy night, the bard took refuge in a rickety inn on the road to Shadowdale. There he performed for his supper, sprinkling his routine with caustic jibes as was his custom. One of the drinkers in the tavern, an old woman, stood up midway through the performance and snapped, "You think it clever to insult and belittle others? Do so, then, for as long as you live!" The bard found himself unable to remove his now-cursed protective bracers and was forced to spout corny jokes until he could pay a wizard to remove them.

I used the spectacles to draw a deva into Avernus.

@45261 = ~Zaviak's Vision Quest

I brought a demon into Avernus.

I summoned a demon and he was actually happy about it. Apparently, the devils and the demons are constantly at war, and through my actions I'd brought the demon into the stronghold of his enemy. He gave me a sword by way of thanks.~
@45262 = ~Zaviak's Vision Quest

I brought a demon into Avernus.
