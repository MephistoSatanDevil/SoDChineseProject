@48585 = ~Sorry, but I've got a lot of work to do with this group. Page doesn't look familiar. Get it together, troops!~
@48586 = ~Let me take a look... no, this isn't mine. Looks like it could be a page from the cipher book of Warden Twoedged. Have you asked her?~ [BD48586]
@48587 = ~Who's Warden Twoedged?~

@48656 = ~One word, one more word, and I swear I'll rip that venomous snake tongue from your mouth.~
@48657 = ~Go suckle on your mother's teat, kitten!~
@48658 = ~The other night, I saw Malden Col leaving my tent. I chased him, but he got away. I'm sure he took the candle, but I can prove nothing. I didn't report it. I planned to... "speak" to Col about it myself. With my fists.~ [BD48658]

@48671 = ~This candle was stolen by Malden Col. He was at your card game last night. Did you win it from him?~
@48672 = ~Forgive me, I misspoke. Luck to you.~
@48673 = ~All you can prove is that I won something in a poker game. That doesn't mean anything. ~
@48674 = ~All of these items came from the same person. That means you're a traitor, Rendahl. ~
@48675 = ~And if I did? I borrowed a book. That proves nothing.~

@48696 = ~I won't waste healing on one who doesn't want it.~

@48707 = ~The Crying God is Ilmater, god of suffering and endurance. Every wracking cough brings me closer to my faith. ~
@48708 = ~You really don't want to be healed because it makes you feel pious?~
@48709 = ~I won't waste healing on one who doesn't want it.~
@48710 = ~You wouldn't understand. Only the faithful can comprehend Ilmater's wisdom and the purity that comes with perseverance.~
@48711 = ~I do understand. Suffering scours the soul, bringing what's truly important into focus.~
@48712 = ~Having studied Ilmater's teachings, I believe I do understand. Ilmater's faithful are to bear what hardships they can, to find strength within.~
@48713 = ~Do you understand what he's saying, Viconia?~
@48714 = ~Glint? Do you know what he's talking about?~
@48715 = ~Ilmater needs faith—we need fighters. If you don't let me heal you, I'll give you suffering beyond your wildest imagining.~
@48716 = ~We need every soldier we can get. If you don't let me heal you, I'll give you more suffering than you know what to do with.~
@48717 = ~I understand we'll need every fighter we can get to defeat Caelar. You must let me heal you.~
@48718 = ~I won't waste healing on one who doesn't want it.~
@48719 = ~You know the Crying God's teachings. Then you understand why I refuse healing.~
@48720 = ~Ilmater teaches us to persevere, but also offers comfort to those in pain. We will need your strength to defeat the Shining Lady. Allow me to heal you.~
@48721 = ~I believe Ilmater permits one to take on the suffering of another. If I injure myself, will you let me heal you?~
@48722 = ~We need every soldier we can get. If you don't let me heal you, I'll give you more suffering than you know what to do with.~
@48723 = ~We need every soldier we can get. If you don't let me heal you, I'll give you more suffering than you know what to do with.~
@48724 = ~I won't waste healing on one who doesn't want it.~
@48725 = ~You've convinced me, stranger. I must think of the greater good instead of my personal faith. You may heal me. ~
@48726 = ~Let me cast this healing spell, then.~
@48727 = ~Here, take this healing potion.~
@48728 = ~Viconia, heal the man.~
@48729 = ~Jaheira, do what you can to alleviate this man's suffering.~
@48730 = ~Glint, do that thing you do.~
@48731 = ~I'll return with a means to heal you, then.~
@48732 = ~V-very well. You've convinced me to think of the greater good instead of my personal faith. ~
@48733 = ~No true follower of Ilmater would deny another the opportunity to suffer. I accept the bargain. ~
@48734 = ~I am ready. ~
@48735 = ~Ilmater's followers embrace pain and loss—they believe suffering is a means to a greater end. Those who worship Shar know the truth: There is nothing noble in suffering needlessly. This man should accept healing and use his strength in service to his fellow fighters.~ [BD48735]
@48736 = ~But Ilmater also offers a balm to pain, which Shar never does. This man should accept our healing and add his strength to the camp.~
@48737 = ~Sort of...? I think? Ilmater worship is utterly bizarre to me. I've heard tell that Ilmater allows others to take the burden of suffering. This is a little odd, but stick with me here—perhaps you could injure yourself in exchange for healing the man?~
@48738 = ~I have heard, though, that Ilmater allows others to take on the burden of suffering. Perhaps you could injure yourself in exchange for healing the man?~
@48739 = ~No. I'm made to suffer for Ilmater's glory. You won't sway me from my faith.~
@48740 = ~Very well. I'll return later if I think of a way to change your mind.~
@48741 = ~We need all the soldiers we can get. I'm healing you whether you like it or not.~
@48742 = ~No! ~
@48743 = ~Healing me against my own wishes—! You have committed a grievous sin this <DAYNIGHTALL>. I'll not forgive this blasphemy. When I'm finished, everyone in this camp will know of your contempt for people of faith.~
@48744 = ~I feel much better! Oh, what have I done? I allowed myself to accept healing and a release from pain.~
@48745 = ~I feel—better... No, no—what have I done? Forgive me, Ilmater; your servant has failed you! But you, <CHARNAME>, you did help me. Take these as thanks. I'll keep the whip, though. After this, I've much to atone for.~
@48746 = ~You go ahead and do that, then.~
@48747 = ~Whatever you need to do. Just keep the details to yourself.~
@48748 = ~Any god that believes good health is something for followers to atone for is not worthy of such devotion. It's your choice, of course, but you're making a foolish one.~
@48749 = ~In your name, Ilmater!~
@48750 = ~Hyreth, you know me. I'm Theodosia Immartyred, a priest of Ilmater.~
@48751 = ~I know you and throw myself at your feet, holy one!~
@48752 = ~Ilmater tells us we must offer healing to those who suffer. I bestow this healing upon you now. Your strength is needed in the fight against the Shining Lady. This is my command as Painbearer.~
@48753 = ~This is my command as Painbearer.~
@48754 = ~I hear and obey.~
@48755 = ~May Ilmater bless you.~
@48756 = ~I'm sorry, but I'm very busy right now. Is there something I can help you with quickly? ~
@48757 = ~I want to talk to you about Hyreth. He's obviously ill, but he won't let me heal him because of his faith. ~
@48758 = ~Oh yes, Hyreth is very devoted, although he's not a priest like me. ~
@48759 = ~Would you talk to him? I think with your influence he'd allow me to help him. ~
@48760 = ~What about it? ~
@48761 = ~Well, I was hoping you'd talk to him. I think with your influence he'd allow me to help him. ~
@48762 = ~I've enough troubles of my own without taking yours on as well. Now leave.~
@48763 = ~Hyreth's faith is very strong. It's not my place to contradict the teachings of Ilmater.~
@48764 = ~His faith puts this entire effort at risk. We'll need every fighter we've got if we're to take Dragonspear.~
@48765 = ~If that's the way you feel, I understand.~
@48766 = ~Ridiculous. You can't let such idiocy cost the coalition valuable soldiers.~
@48767 = ~I see your point. Go talk to Hyreth again and I'll come and support you.~
@48768 = ~Thank you. Now I must return to work.~
@48769 = ~Such "idiocy" grants me the power to heal ANY soldier. If you would fight the Shining Lady without battlefield healing, you should feel free to do so. Now excuse me, I've patients that need attention.~
@48770 = ~I'll not tell Hyreth, or anyone, to go against their faith. I'm sorry.~
@48771 = ~If that's the way you feel, I understand.~
@48772 = ~This idiocy puts our entire effort at risk. Your absurd god is costing us valuable soldiers!~
@48773 = ~Word to the wise, friend. There are eyes upon you. We'll expect preliminary payment in the next tenday. 5,000 gold pieces. Don't be short.~
@48774 = ~What do you mean? Who are you?~
@48775 = ~Preliminary payment for what?~
@48776 = ~You'll be short a head if you try to take my gold. What's this all about?~
@48777 = ~You know. Your reputation preceeds you, after all. ~
@48778 = ~What reputation?~
@48779 = ~Speak plainly. Who do you represent?~
@48780 = ~Anyone who tries to take my money is going to suffer for it.~
@48781 = ~Ask your friend Safana. She know how this works.~
@48782 = ~Safana, what's going on here?~
@48783 = ~What reputation?~
@48784 = ~Speak plainly. Who do you represent?~
@48785 = ~If you think I'll hand my gold over willingly, you're the one who needs to learn how things work.~
@48786 = ~Someone's trying to organize a thieves' guild.~
@48787 = ~You mean thieves. ~
@48788 = ~The first payment expected is 5,000 gold pieces. Don't be short. ~
@48789 = ~Wait, I have questions.~
@48790 = ~Tell your masters they're not getting a single copper piece from me.~
@48791 = ~If I ever see you again, you're dead.~
@48792 = ~5,000 gold. We'll be in touch.~
@48793 = ~Greetings, my <PRO_LADYLORD>. In the market for a new weapon? Or perhaps a potion? ~
@48794 = ~Let me see what you have.~
@48795 = ~I'm in the market for something out of the ordinary.~
@48796 = ~I heard you were a fence for the thieves' guild here.~
@48797 = ~Have you heard about the sickness going around camp? I have a cure for it and I'm looking for a buyer.~
@48798 = ~I think you'll be happy with my selection.~
@48799 = ~What did you have in mind?~
@48800 = ~Let's just say I have something unique I picked up on my travels. Something a powerful individual would be interested in. Know anyone like that?~
@48801 = ~Nothing, I misspoke. Can you show me your regular goods?~
@48802 = ~I should be able to set something up. Come to the camp's northern edge. I'll have someone there to meet with you.~
@48803 = ~I'm afraid you've been misinformed, my <PRO_LADYLORD>.~
@48804 = ~Excellent. I'll be there.~
@48805 = ~I don't think so, and that's a good thing. I have no intention of shutting you down. In fact, I'd like to meet a representative for the thieves' guild in camp. Can you arrange it?~
@48806 = ~I've no patience for your games. I need to meet with someone from the thieves' guild. Set it up, or things will get very unpleasant for you.~
@48807 = ~I can tell you've never been properly cursed before. I promise that will change if you don't arrange a meeting 'twixt me and a thieves' guild representative. Don't try me on this, woman.~
@48808 = ~You're sorely mistaken. I'm not a thief and I'll thank you not to insult me anymore. Good day.~
@48809 = ~As if a paladin would want to meet with thieves! You're trying to trick me somehow and I'm not falling for it. Good day.~
@48810 = ~All right, all right. Come to the north edge of camp when it's dark. I'll have someone ready to meet you.~
@48811 = ~I'll be there. ~
@48812 = ~I'll take my chances. Now get gone.~
@48813 = ~Actually, I did hear the crusaders have been stricken with illness. They're offering 250 gold for a cure.~
@48814 = ~A good price. I accept.~
@48815 = ~I think someone else might pay more for it. No deal.~
@48816 = ~As you like. Luck to you.~
@48817 = ~You've made a good bargain today.~
@48818 = ~Luck to you.~
@48819 = ~What you see is what I've got.~
@48820 = ~那么，让我看看你的普通货物。~
@48821 = ~I heard you carried more exotic items. Things procured via, shall we say, less than ethical means.~
@48822 = ~You killed them. Both of them. ~
@48823 = ~They left me little choice.~
@48824 = ~It happens. Frequently.~
@48825 = ~If you'd not join them, start talking. Now.~
@48826 = ~I like the way you think, friend. The cadre will too. Come to the camp's north edge after dark. I'll have someone ready to meet you.~
@48827 = ~I'll be there. ~
@48828 = ~Good day to you. ~
@48829 = ~You wanted to meet with me. Here I am. ~
@48830 = ~I heard you're setting up a thieves' guild in camp. I'm here to stop you.~
@48831 = ~I hear there's an association of independent business people forming in camp. I want to join.~
@48832 = ~I know you're part of this would-be thieves' guild trying to make a profit off a war. Disband at once or pay the price.~
@48833 = ~I had a feeling you were going to say that. I know too much about you to do as you ask. But I'll tell you what—we'll rein in our activities from now on. That's the best you're going to get.~
@48834 = ~See you when the arrows start flying.~
@48835 = ~You've got adamantine nerves, I'll give you that much. I could have a dozen hidden thieves with poisoned crossbows just waiting in the shadows.~
@48836 = ~You'd better use those thieves to our benefit. I'm the hero of Baldur's Gate, and you know I could have your operation and you executed in a heartbeat. No more thieving, and when the time for war comes, I'd better see you on the front lines.~
@48837 = ~Yeah, I've faced hordes of bow-wielding enemies before. Guess where they are? Taking a dirt nap, while I'm here staring you down.~
@48838 = ~I'll kill every one of your minions, but not until I kill you!~
@48839 = ~And I thought I was cutthroat. Fine, our loot is hidden in under some fallen rocks, in the forest near that underground cavern. The rocks are directly east of the cave entrance where all the crusaders are camped out.~
@48840 = ~Much appreciated. Now be on your way.~
@48841 = ~I would have been much better at organizing your guild, just so you know. Scram.~
@48842 = ~Thank you for the information. I'll make good use of it after you're dead.~
@48843 = ~All right, all right! I thought we'd kept our activities quiet, but not quiet enough, it seems. I'll have my people come to the coalition's side when the battle breaks. Good enough?~
@48844 = ~You won't take me down!~
@48845 = ~No more! I surrender! ~
@48846 = ~Why should I spare your life?~
@48847 = ~Tell me who's organized all the thieves in camp.~
@48848 = ~Too little, too late. Die!~
@48849 = ~No! ~
@48850 = ~They forced me to join! I didn't want to! I can tell you who's in charge—please, don't kill me!~
@48851 = ~Tell me what I would know and I promise you will live.~
@48852 = ~Your life is in your own hands now. Tell me what I want to know and you might walk away from this. Or limp away from it, at least.~
@48853 = ~I make no promises. Give me the name or your death is assured.~
@48854 = ~I will, but you have to promise not to kill me! ~
@48855 = ~I promise to let you live.~
@48856 = ~If your information is good, I'll probably let you live.~
@48857 = ~I make no promises. Tell me or die for certain.~
@48858 = ~It's one of de Lancie's men, Gramorn! He's been secretly gathering all the thieves under his command.~
@48859 = ~Why is he doing this?~
@48860 = ~Why? What's Gramorn's plan?~
@48861 = ~Where can I find Gramorn?~
@48862 = ~Now to deal with you.~
@48863 = ~I don't know for sure. I'm new and he hasn't told me anything. ~
@48864 = ~He's taking fifty percent of what he expects thieves in camp to make, whether they actually steal that much or not. And he's collecting secrets.~
@48865 = ~He's usually with the troops from Waterdeep. De Lancie could catch him easily, I bet. ~
@48866 = ~Wh-what are you going to do to me? ~
@48867 = ~Execute you, for your crimes against this camp and my own person.~
@48868 = ~I should cut you down where you stand, but I'll not waste the energy. The guards can have you.~
@48869 = ~But you promised to let me live! ~
@48870 = ~I lied.~
@48871 = ~All right. The guards can have you. Other matters need my attention now, anyway.~
@48872 = ~Thank you. Thank you! ~
@48873 = ~What do you want? ~
@48874 = ~You are Gramorn, are you not? I've heard you're behind the camp's burgeoning thieves' guild.~
@48875 = ~That depends entirely on who you are.~
@48876 = ~I'd like more information on the camp, if you're of a mind to give it.~
@48877 = ~Nothing right now.~
@48878 = ~Aumarr Reinss Gramorn, of Waterdeep. I answer to Torsin de Lancie. ~
@48879 = ~I've heard that you're the man behind the thieves' guild in camp.~
@48880 = ~Aumarr? Torsin?~
@48881 = ~Tell me what's going on with the camp, Aumarr.~
@48882 = ~I need to be going.~
@48883 = ~Titles for the city guard of Waterdeep. You can think of de Lancie as a colonel and me as a captain. ~
@48884 = ~Is it true you're behind the thieves' guild in camp? I heard someone say that.~
@48885 = ~A captain, eh? Can you tell me how our effort against Caelar is progressing?~
@48886 = ~Interesting. I think I'll be moving along now.~
@48887 = ~Detachments from Waterdeep's city guard, the Flaming Fist, and Daggerford's militia have laid a perimeter around Dragonspear Castle. We're in decent shape, especially now that reinforcements from Baldur's Gate have arrived.~
@48888 = ~I've heard you're behind the camp's thieves' guild.~
@48889 = ~Remind me again who you are...?~
@48890 = ~Good to know. I'll leave you to your duties.~
@48891 = ~On your way, then.~
@48892 = ~You've heard wrong.~
@48893 = ~I don't think so. Cut me in on your take or I'll go straight to de Lancie with what I know.~
@48894 = ~I know the truth. Surrender, now.~
@48895 = ~Ah. Forgive me, then. I'll leave you to your duties.~
@48896 = ~Well, well. You're an opportunistic little rodent, aren't you? How much do you want?~
@48897 = ~500 gold will do to start.~
@48898 = ~1,000 gold and not a copper less.~
@48899 = ~This farce is at an end, Gramorn. Surrender.~
@48900 = ~I'll pay you, because you're more valuable to me alive than dead. Someone with your qualities will make a good addition to the team.~
@48901 = ~I'm not part of your team.~
@48902 = ~I might be interested in working with you.~
@48903 = ~You presume too much, Gramorn. I work alone.~
@48904 = ~We'll see. Luck to you.~
@48905 = ~You had a chance, <CHARNAME>, but then you got greedy. I'll take my chances with de Lancie.~
@48906 = ~Drop your weapons, then.~
@48907 = ~You'll take your chances with me, dead man.~
@48908 = ~Or what? You'll kill me?~
@48909 = ~I'm an aumarr in the Waterdeep City Guard. You even look at me sideways and every Waterdhavian soldier in this camp will be upon you. ~
@48910 = ~I'll explain after you're dead.~
@48911 = ~I might not be able to take you out now, but watch yourself. I know where you sleep.~
@48912 = ~You'll be on the ground in a pool of blood before you can shout a single word. Face it. You can't touch me here. ~
@48913 = ~I might not be able to take you out now, but watch yourself. I know where you sleep. ~
@48914 = ~You've ruined my plans! Now die! ~
@48915 = ~Time to pay up. 5,000 gold. Hand it over.~
@48916 = ~What am I supposed to be paying for, exactly?~
@48917 = ~Here's an idea: Why don't I not give you 5,000 gold pieces, and you run away from here as fast as your legs can carry you?~
@48918 = ~Come and take it, if you think you're able.~
@48919 = ~It's the price of doing business in camp. Are you going to pay up or is this going to get ugly?~
@48920 = ~I don't plan on doing any "business" in camp. I'm not interested in joining your guild.~
@48921 = ~How about you hand over YOUR money?~
@48922 = ~If I had a hundred times that much gold, I still wouldn't give you a single coin.~
@48923 = ~It may surprise you to learn that I don't care. If you won't give me the gold, I guess I'll just have to take it.~
@48924 = ~How about I break your legs and then just take the cadre's due? Yeah, let's try that instead.~
@48925 = ~If you won't give me the payment, I'll just have to take it.~
@48926 = ~You have been chosen not because you are the strongest or the wisest.~ [BD48926]
@48927 = ~You have been chosen because you have heart and the faith to see the crusade to its end!~ [BD48927]
@48928 = ~You will storm the gates of the Nine Hells!~ [BD48928]
@48929 = ~You will slay the devils within and claim their realm for good!~ [BD48929]
@48930 = ~You may be frightened, but you will cast aside all doubt!~ [BD48930]
@48931 = ~You are MEANT to be here! You will do great deeds here, because YOU are Caelar's chosen!~ [BD48931]
@48932 = ~Hello, recruit. You must be new. ~
@48933 = ~Yes, I just joined a short time ago.~
@48934 = ~What gave me away?~
@48935 = ~I may be new, but I'm not inexperienced in the ways of war.~
@48936 = ~I don't recognize your face, recruit. Are you new? There are so many newcomers to the cause these days I can't keep track of them all. That's a good thing.~ [BD48936]
@48937 = ~I can see that. Well, I'm pleased to make your acquaintance.~
@48938 = ~I'm Deneld, the morale officer of this camp. What's your name?~ [BD48938]
@48939 = ~I'm <CHARNAME>.~
@48940 = ~You can call me Ensler.~
@48941 = ~I left my old name behind when I joined the crusade.~
@48942 = ~Hst! Perhaps you should be more cautious with your name.~
@48943 = ~<CHARNAME>, is it? I've heard that name before...~ [BD48943]
@48944 = ~I get that a lot. I share the name of a famous general or something.~
@48945 = ~I'm also known as the hero of Baldur's Gate.~
@48946 = ~We've never met.~
@48947 = ~Well, never mind that. Let me ask you about the crusade. What do you know about our mission here?~ [BD48947]
@48948 = ~It has something to do with marching into the Nine Hells and killing fiends, doesn't it?~
@48949 = ~I know we follow the Shining Lady Caelar. She guides us in whatever we do.~
@48950 = ~It let me escape from my old life. That's all I need to know.~
@48951 = ~Excellent. Sacrificing a name is a small but moving tribute to Caelar's grace. Would that more recruits displayed such devotion to the Lady.~ [BD48951]
@48952 = ~It has something to do with marching into the Nine Hells and killing fiends, doesn't it?~
@48953 = ~I know we follow Caelar, the Shining Lady. She guides whatever we do.~
@48954 = ~All I know is it let me escape from my old life.~
@48955 = ~Wait... it's you—it's YOU. INTRUDER!~ [BD48955]
@48956 = ~What a coincidence, there's another Sallo here who joined us some time ago. You even look like you could be twins! ~
@48957 = ~Of course, you can always find THAT Sallo passed out behind the wine casks. Such a shame. I hope you're not like that.~
@48958 = ~I can honestly say the other Sallo and I are two different people.~
@48959 = ~I prefer to pass out behind the ale kegs.~
@48960 = ~We're opposite as night and day.~
@48961 = ~Well met, Ensler. Let me ask you something. What do you know about our mission here?~ [BD48961]
@48962 = ~It has something to do with marching into the Nine Hells and killing fiends, doesn't it?~
@48963 = ~I know we follow the Shining Lady Caelar. She guides us in whatever we do.~
@48964 = ~It let me escape from my old life. That's all I need to know.~
@48965 = ~Well, that's a start. There's a great deal more you can learn about the crusade, though. Why don't you speak to some of the other crusaders in camp?~ [BD48965]
@48966 = ~Speaking to the c-crusaders isn't a bad idea. We m-might gain some insight into our enemies' minds.~
@48967 = ~The stammering lackwit is right, for once. What you understand you can more easily destroy.~
@48968 = ~After you've talked to some of the others, return here and demonstrate your new knowledge. I'll present you with a token signifying your understanding of our glorious cause. Sound good? Of course it does! See you soon.~ [BD48968]
@48969 = ~I'll speak to some of the other crusaders, then.~
@48970 = ~Sure, I'll see if anyone here has anything interesting to say.~
@48971 = ~I might, if I decide I can spare the time.~
@48972 = ~For the glory of the crusade, recruit. ~
@48973 = ~Ah, the new recruit returns. Have you spoken to your fellow crusaders and learned of our cause?~ [BD48973]
@48974 = ~I have, yes.~
@48975 = ~I think there is still more I might learn.~
@48976 = ~Learn from others' tales, then, and return to me when you are ready to review what you've discovered.~ [BD48976]
@48977 = ~In that case, let the testing begin.~ [BD48977]
@48978 = ~The sooner this pointless exercise is over with, the better.~ [BD48978]
@48979 = ~Answer me this: Why? Why does the crusade exist?~ [BD48979]
@48980 = ~Devils are evil creatures, monstrous jailers of mortal souls. The crusade will rid existence of their wickedness and free all the trapped souls of the Hells.~
@48981 = ~Crusades rise to remedy injustices that cannot be addressed by other means. Caelar seeks to repair the damage the Hells have wreaked upon this land.~
@48982 = ~A crusade's nature is to set right a terrible wrong. The Shining Lady seeks nothing less than freedom for the innocent souls trapped in the Nine Hells.~
@48983 = ~The Shining Lady called to us. We answered.~
@48984 = ~No one had anything better to do, I imagine.~
@48985 = ~To fight fiends and find glory in battle!~
@48986 = ~That is true... but it's not the answer I sought. You still have much to learn.~ [BD48986]
@48987 = ~I'll do better next time.~
@48988 = ~What are you talking about? There's nothing wrong with my answer.~
@48989 = ~This interrogation grows tiresome.~
@48990 = ~You're not the first to hide fear and uncertainty behind weak humor. Talk to more of your fellow toilers in light—see if you can find reassurance in what they tell you.~ [BD48990]
@48991 = ~Excellent. A perfect answer to my question.~ [BD48991]
@48992 = ~A unique interpretation of the crusade, one which shows a deep understanding of the Shining Lady's cause.~ [BD48992]
@48993 = ~My next question is this: How will the crusade achieve victory?~ [BD48993]
@48994 = ~Faith ensures the crusade's ultimate success. Our personal faith strengthens us; Caelar's faith will protect us when we descend into the Nine Hells.~
@48995 = ~Caelar raises her followers' spirits and gives them hope where before there was nothing but hopelessness. In doing so, she makes the weakest of her crusaders strong, ensuring success.~
@48996 = ~Logic says we would be destroyed the moment we breach the Nine Hells. Caelar is a holy warrior. Her faith is our shield against the inferno.~
@48997 = ~Strength of numbers will bring us victory.~
@48998 = ~To be honest, I think we'll probably fail.~
@48999 = ~If we believe hard enough, we can do anything.~
@49000 = ~You have learned Caelar's lessons well, my friend. I'm impressed.~ [BD49000]
@49001 = ~Not the answer I expected, but I can't fault your thinking.~ [BD49001]
@49002 = ~Now for the final question. What is the heart of the crusade?~ [BD49002]
@49003 = ~Caelar Argent is the crusade's heart and soul. Her faith and purity inspire all who follow her. Without the Shining Lady, the crusade would crumble.~
@49004 = ~A powerful leader's importance to a movement such as ours can't be understated. Without a strong commander at its head, an army falls apart. Caelar is the heart of the crusade—I can see no other answer to the question.~
@49005 = ~We may have different reasons for being here, but all crusaders are united by the Shining Lady. She is what draws us together.~
@49006 = ~The desire to do good in this world.~
@49007 = ~Is it stupidity? I'm going to go with stupidity.~
@49008 = ~Righteousness born of virtue.~
@49009 = ~Wonderful. That's precisely the right answer.~
@49010 = ~You show impressive insight into the light that guides us.~ [BD49010]
@49011 = ~Well done! You truly understand the many and varied facets of our movement. I applaud you.~ [BD49011]
@49012 = ~It was a pleasure to learn about our glorious crusade.~
@49013 = ~And I get a reward now, right? I distinctly remember you mentioning a reward.~
@49014 = ~If there's nothing more, I must move on.~
@49015 = ~You don't need to lay it on quite so thick, <CHARNAME>.~ [BD49015]
@49016 = ~Accept from me this ring to mark your commitment to our cause. It will help protect you in battle. Now go forth, and bring Caelar's glory to this world!~ [BD49016]
@49017 = ~Though your answer was technically accurate, it lacks the depth I'm looking for here. You can do better.~ [BD49017]
@49018 = ~I'll try.~
@49019 = ~Why do YOU get to say what the truth is about the crusade? My answer's as good as any you could give.~
@49020 = ~If I've the time—and the inclination—I may return.~
@49021 = ~Careful, hero. You want to answer questions, not raise them.~ [BD49021]
@49022 = ~You question my worth? I'm one of Caelar's most trusted lieutenants. Surely you learned of me when you joined the crusade.~ [BD49022]
@49023 = ~Of course. I just—got a little worked up. I care about the crusade so much. It's embarrassing to be told my view of it is wrong.~
@49024 = ~All I've learned is you're an overbearing blowhard who holds himself in far too high a regard. No wonder the crusade is such a mess.~
@49025 = ~I misspoke. My apologies.~
@49026 = ~I understand. Calm yourself. Continue speaking to the other crusaders. In time you will learn what you need to know.~ [BD49026]
@49027 = ~Your words reveal your true intentions. Crusaders! To me! THE ENEMY IS AMONG US!~ [BD49027]
@49028 = ~You lookin' at me? ~
@49029 = ~I am.~
@49030 = ~Not at all.~
@49031 = ~You have a problem with that, orc?~
@49032 = ~Stop it. I don't like bein' looked at. ~
@49033 = ~Why did you join the crusade, then? I imagine there are many people looking at you here.~
@49034 = ~Pray forgive me. I'll leave you alone.~
@49035 = ~You think I care what you like, you wretched monster?~
@49036 = ~Good. I don't like bein' looked at. ~
@49037 = ~Y'don't watch your mouth, you're gonna care. ~
@49038 = ~Explain this to me, please. Why did you join the crusade if you want to be left alone?~
@49039 = ~I've better things to do with my time than waste it on the likes of you.~
@49040 = ~Come on then. Make me care.~
@49041 = ~Crush your skull and gnaw on your bones!~
@49042 = ~Yeah. 'Swhat I thought.~
@49043 = ~Ravoc's fought devils before. Wants a chance to gnaw on their bones.~
@49044 = ~That's all? You're just looking for a good fight?~
@49045 = ~What a deep and nuanced motivation. I need some time to digest all that information.~
@49046 = ~So a monster wants the chance to kill other monsters?~
@49047 = ~A monster walks beside you, <CHARNAME>. Consider your words, lest you say something I'll have to make you regret.~
@49048 = ~Packs of fiends stalked the mountains not long ago. Portal opened in Ravoc's camp once. Red-winged killers spilled out. Tore our strongest apart without half thinking about it.~
@49049 = ~That must have been terrifying.~
@49050 = ~So that's where you got your first taste for devil flesh?~
@49051 = ~A battle between orcs and devils must have been a bloody affair.~
@49052 = ~I weren't scared! Watch your tongue or I'll spit it on m' dagger. ~
@49053 = ~I only meant the battle must have been a vicious one.~
@49054 = ~How can I watch my tongue? It's inside my mouth.~
@49055 = ~Calm down, brute, and finish your story.~
@49056 = ~Ravoc'll help you with that if y'don't watch out.~
@49057 = ~Took all our warriors to take out three devils. Their bones'r like steel and they tore our strongest in half without half thinking about it.~
@49058 = ~A score of us were lost taking down just three of 'em. Shaman said our dead didn't get to Gruumsh's realm. Their souls're trapped in the Hells below.~
@49059 = ~That's why you joined the crusade? Vengeance against the fiends?~
@49060 = ~Even an orc doesn't deserve that fate.~
@49061 = ~Get to the point.~
@49062 = ~When Ravoc sees the Shining Lady's light, he knows time has come to free his brothers.~
@49063 = ~Thank you for telling me your story, Ravoc.~
@49064 = ~That's... actually a pretty good reason to join the crusade. ~
@49065 = ~Should we ever reach the Hells, you wouldn't last two minutes.~
@49066 = ~Get outta here now. Don't like you lookin' at me.~
@49067 = ~Ravoc'll kill every fiend he sees! Get outta my way.~
@49068 = ~Watch his claw! Do you want to be disembowelled? ~
@49069 = ~Are you a troll handler?~
@49070 = ~I have some questions for you.~
@49071 = ~You seem busy. I'll come back later.~
@49072 = ~No time to talk. We have to get this troll under control!~
@49073 = ~Is that a drow accompanying you?~
@49074 = ~Who, Baeloth? He's a friend of mine.~
@49075 = ~You mean Viconia? Don't worry, she's trustworthy.~
@49076 = ~A drow! Where?~
@49077 = ~Beware, I behold the brand of Shevarash upon this beauty's amulet. She serves the sentinel of elven settlements, the slaughterer of drow.~
@49078 = ~We need to leave, now. This woman wears a holy symbol of Shevarash, hunter of drow.~
@49079 = ~If these drow are friends of yours, you are no friend of mine. I know the crusade attracts all types, but I'll never speak to a drow. Goodbye.~
@49080 = ~Right there! Get it!~
@49081 = ~I'm assisting the troll handlers. I'm a priest and able to heal anyone who takes a claw to the face. Usually.~
@49082 = ~Is that why you joined the crusade? To heal people?~
@49083 = ~Seems like a dangerous job. I'll leave you to it.~
@49084 = ~I have some questions for you.~
@49085 = ~You could say that. Are you familiar with Shevarash?~ [BD49085]
@49086 = ~He's an elven god of revenge, is he not? His faithful often hunt drow.~
@49087 = ~I've heard the name. He's some sort of vengeance god...?~
@49088 = ~Of course. The Black Archer guides his faithful toward just vengeance.~
@49089 = ~No, I'm afraid I'm not.~
@49090 = ~Of course. Good ol' Shevarash. ~
@49091 = ~Why should I care about your faith?~
@49092 = ~Many servants of Shevarash focus on our enemy, the drow, but he is also the god of crusades. I thought by coming here I might learn tactics I could take back home, while doing some good.~ [BD49092]
@49093 = ~So you consider this a holy calling?~
@49094 = ~I hate to tell you this but there probably won't be many drow in the Nine Hells.~
@49095 = ~Slaughtering your enemies is truly a righteous calling.~
@49096 = ~Indeed it is. I can understand the draw of a crusade that promises vengeance to one's enemies.~
@49097 = ~I thought I could learn tactics from the crusade that I could bring back to my settlement, all the while doing some good.~
@49098 = ~Instead I gained a new appreciation of the power of faith. Caelar is so pure, so driven. She has accessed power that will protect us in the Nine Hells themselves.~ [BD49098]
@49099 = ~That's incredible.~
@49100 = ~Caelar's something, all right.~
@49101 = ~So she says. I have my doubts.~
@49102 = ~ 'Tis a wondrous thing to experience the power of true faith. I felt it when I dedicated myself to the Sly One. Perhaps you'd like to hear about his teachings?~ [BD49102]
@49103 = ~I hope I can achieve Caelar's level of devotion someday, and harness it as she has to protect my people from the Underdark.~ [BD49103]
@49104 = ~If Caelar truly can shield us from the Hells' fury, I'm sure you can manage the same against the Underdark.~
@49105 = ~Good luck with that.~
@49106 = ~A noble aim.~
@49107 = ~I need to get back to work now. Have a good day. ~
@49108 = ~Sorry, did you say something? ~
@49109 = ~"Hello."~
@49110 = ~You seem a little distracted.~
@49111 = ~Pay more attention. If we were attacked right now, you'd be caught completely off guard.~
@49112 = ~I'm sorry, I was thinking about... well, it's nothing. I should get back to work. ~
@49113 = ~I'd like to know what you were thinking about.~
@49114 = ~Goodbye, then.~
@49115 = ~Yes, you should.~
@49116 = ~May the Shining Lady's light guide you always.~
@49117 = ~Don't misunderstand me, but... I was thinking about Caelar.~
@49118 = ~That's understandable. She is our leader.~
@49119 = ~She's an attractive woman.~
@49120 = ~You should be thinking more about battle.~
@49121 = ~Soldiers m-must stay focused, even during between c-combats.~
@49122 = ~Not everyone can spend every waking moment thinking about battles. Some of us have more varied tastes.~ [BD49122]
@49123 = ~No! That's not what I mean at all.~
@49124 = ~I know, I know. She's so mesmerizing, though.~
@49125 = ~When Caelar spoke in my village, every word she said seemed to sear itself on my heart. It was like I was listening to a herald of utter truth.~
@49126 = ~When Caelar spoke in my village, every word she said seemed to—to sear itself on my heart. It was like I was listening to a herald of utter truth. Following her was an easy decision—it was OBVIOUSLY the thing to do.~
@49127 = ~She is a gifted orator, to be sure.~
@49128 = ~And now? Do you still believe the things she says?~
@49129 = ~Natural leaders always attract natural followers.~
@49130 = ~Caelar could never lie, I'm sure of it.~
@49131 = ~She shines like the morning star. Had anyone else come to my town, I'd not have joined the crusade. But I'll follow the Shining Lady anywhere.~
@49132 = ~I understand. Thanks for talking to me.~
@49133 = ~That's creepy. You know that, right? Creepy.~
@49134 = ~Into the Nine Hells itself, it seems.~
@49135 = ~Sorry, I didn't catch that. My mind was elsewhere. It's time for a drill now, but I can speak with you later. ~
@49136 = ~Watch out!~
@49137 = ~Watch the claws, watch the claws!~
@49138 = ~Shoot her! SHOOT HER!~
@49139 = ~Keep back! Everyone keep back!~
@49140 = ~Be careful!~
@49141 = ~Watch his claw! Do you want to be disembowelled? ~ [BD49141]
@49142 = ~Are you a troll handler?~
@49143 = ~I have some questions for you.~
@49144 = ~You seem busy. I'll come back later.~
@49145 = ~Get out of here! I need to get this troll under control and you aren't helping!~
@49146 = ~Is that a drow by your side?~
@49147 = ~Who, Baeloth? He's a friend of mine.~
@49148 = ~You mean Viconia? Don't worry, she's trustworthy.~
@49149 = ~A drow! Where?~
@49150 = ~Beware, I behold Shevarash's brand upon this beauty's amulet. She serves the sentinel of elven settlements, the slaughterer of drow.~ [BD49150]
@49151 = ~We need to leave, now. This woman wears a holy symbol of Shevarash, hunter of drow.~ [BD49151]
@49152 = ~If you count a drow as a friend of yours, you are no friend of mine. The crusade accepts all who swear loyalty to Caelar. I do not. Luck to you—if you continue throwing your lot in with this scum, you'll surely need it.~
@49153 = ~Right there! Get it!~
@49154 = ~No, but I assist them. I can heal anyone who takes a claw to the face. Usually.~
@49155 = ~Looks like you're having some trouble. Can I be of assistance?~
@49156 = ~Seems like a dangerous job. I'll leave you to it.~
@49157 = ~I have some questions for you.~
@49158 = ~Actually, yes. We can't find Gnarg, the regular troll keeper. He keeps troll shackles in a chest back in the camp. Go get them.~ [BD49158]
@49159 = ~Yes, ma'am.~
@49160 = ~How will I recognize the chest?~
@49161 = ~我有更重要的事要做。~
@49162 = ~Watch those claws, soldiers!~
@49163 = ~It's next to one of the black and white tents.~
@49164 = ~I'll bring them right back.~
@49165 = ~我有更重要的事要做。~
@49166 = ~Excuse me, RECRUIT, but I'm your superior and I'm giving you a direct order. Fetch those shackles or I'll see you wearing a pair of your own!~
@49167 = ~This monster isn't subduing itself, recruit! Do you have the shackles?~
@49168 = ~Yes, I have them right here.~
@49169 = ~I need a little more time.~
@49170 = ~Hurry up! We can't keep this troll at bay forever.~
@49171 = ~Good job—now get in there and slap those shackles on the beast!~
@49172 = ~I'm on it!~
@49173 = ~Uhhh... What?~
@49174 = ~The monster will submit—or die.~
@49175 = ~Why?~ [BD49175]
@49176 = ~That's the spirit. We'll be right here if you need help!~
@49177 = ~Show some backbone, <PRO_MANWOMAN>! Go in there and tame that monster!~
@49178 = ~I'll get right on that.~
@49179 = ~You want it tamed, go in there and do it yourself.~
@49180 = ~It will break, or die.~
@49181 = ~See this insignia? It means I outrank you—I give the orders here. Get in there, or by Shevarash, there will be consequences!~
@49182 = ~I may look like a simple recruit, but I'm actually on assignment from Caelar, canvassing the troops undercover, evaluating morale.~
@49183 = ~I'll give it a try.~
@49184 = ~Uh, have you actually seen that thing? I'm not going anywhere near it!~
@49185 = ~You're out of order, recruit! Insubordination must be dealt with firmly!~
@49186 = ~You're out of order, recruit. Lying and insubordination must be dealt with firmly!~
@49187 = ~You do look familiar. ~
@49188 = ~Take these shackles and put them on the troll. Now. That's an order.~
@49189 = ~I'll handle the troll, but you'd better be ready to back me up. And in future, mind your tone.~
@49190 = ~Yes, <PRO_SIRMAAM>.~
@49191 = ~As you order, <PRO_SIRMAAM>.~
@49192 = ~Raaaargh! ~
@49193 = ~Uh... Well met, friend. What's your name?~
@49194 = ~Calm down there, Mister Troll. I'm not here to hurt you.~
@49195 = ~Troll! Lie down and hold your hands out. Do as I say!~
@49196 = ~RAAARGH! Trollop! ~
@49197 = ~There's no need for name-calling.~
@49198 = ~Trollop? You're a female?~
@49199 = ~Lie down and present your hands. Obey me, damn you!~
@49200 = ~Back, skinny bites! Back from Ulori! ~
@49201 = ~Ulori? That's you, that's your name?~
@49202 = ~There'll be no biting here today. Now lie down and be quiet.~
@49203 = ~Get down on the ground and hold out your hands. DO IT!~
@49204 = ~AAAUGH! Time to eat! YOU! ~
@49205 = ~Try it. I'll tear you apart and burn the pieces. Lie down and be still!~
@49206 = ~Time is but a construct. In one sense, you have already eaten me, and will consume me again. Using a more standard linear chronology, however, that hasn't happened yet. Nor will it any time soon, as you are about to lie down and be still.~
@49207 = ~You're clearly anxious, and understandably so. Let me sing you a song to soothe your nerves.~
@49208 = ~Take one more step toward me, troll, and you'll regret it.~
@49209 = ~This doesn't have to end in bloodshed. Do as I command and I won't hurt you.~
@49210 = ~Tasty elf! Soft outside with crunch inside! ~
@49211 = ~You strong! Me no bite! ~
@49212 = ~That's better. Hold still while I put these shackles on you. ~
@49213 = ~Huh? ~
@49214 = ~The "arrow of time" flies ever forward. Your capitulation is assured, as, in a very real sense, you have already surrendered to my will. You don't want to alter the timestream, do you?~
@49215 = ~N-no? ~
@49216 = ~That's right. Chronological disruption carries with it dire consequences. So lie down now, and I'll put these shackles on you.~
@49217 = ~Ulori like music. ~
@49218 = ~Then you'll love this. I call it, "Troll Lullaby." It goes like this: "Go to sleep, massive troll, and dream of your dinner..." ~
@49219 = ~Nice... music... zzzzz.~
@49220 = ~Yah, Ulori stay still.~
@49221 = ~Rip your flesh and chew on the bones!~
@49222 = ~You're back. ~
@49223 = ~I've come to claim my reward.~
@49224 = ~You look none the worse for wear.~
@49225 = ~I have a few questions.~
@49226 = ~Sorry, I have to track down Gnarg and finish a hundred other tasks. We'll have to talk later.~
@49227 = ~You did a good job, recruit. Here, these potions should serve as a token of my gratitude. You'll need them when we challenge the enemies gathering beyond the gates. They do devils' work. We'll have to put them down.~
@49228 = ~You're going to need them when we go up against that coalition building outside the gates. They've allied with devils and we'll have to put them down!~
@49229 = ~Well, I guess you did a good enough job. Of BOTCHING everything up COMPLETELY.~
@49230 = ~Damn it! You were to shackle the troll, not kill it! The Shining Lady could have used its strength and you just wasted it! Go, get out of my sight before I throw you in the stocks!~
@49231 = ~Yes, <PRO_SIRMAAM>, I was able to patch up the survivors. More or less. Now if you'll excuse me, I have work to do.~
@49232 = ~I changed my mind. I won't waste healing on one who doesn't want it.~
@49233 = ~Is there anything I can do to help?~
@49234 = ~I want to talk to you about Hyreth. He's obviously ill but won't let me heal him because of his faith.~
@49235 = ~We need to talk about Hyreth. He's obviously ill, but he won't let me heal him because of his faith.~
@49236 = ~You can make time to talk to the hero of Baldur's Gate, I'm sure.~
@49237 = ~Tell me who you are and what's going on. Now.~
@49238 = ~Is there anything I can do to help?~
@49239 = ~If you can't deal with Hyreth, you WILL deal with me. What's your name?~
@49240 = ~We have the vampire cornered. He's riddled the path with traps so we can't get to him, but by the same token, his only way out is through us. We expect him to appear any moment. You ready for a fight?~
@49241 = ~I'm ready.~
@49242 = ~Give me a few minutes to prepare.~
@49243 = ~Always, though I'm not sure this is one I care to get involved in.~
@49244 = ~Fight your own battles.~
@49245 = ~Don't take too long. The vampire could appear at any time. ~
@49246 = ~Look! There, in the trees!~
@49247 = ~Isabella? Our friend is still here...~ [BD49247]
@49248 = ~Oh, for the love of... here. Try to hold on to this one.~
@49249 = ~Are you sure you got them all? I don't want to risk walking into the one snare you missed. The vampire is harmless now; just go find the body and stake it.~
@49250 = ~Get going, then!~
@49251 = ~I lost the stake. Do you have another?~
@49252 = ~I disarmed the traps leading to the vampire's lair.~
@49253 = ~I'll return when the vampire is destroyed.~
@49254 = ~Isabella... my dear companion. I won't rest until I return you to life!~ [BD49254]
@49255 = ~What is it? What do you want?~
@49256 = ~I lost my stake. Do you have another?~
@49257 = ~I disarmed the traps leading to the vampire's lair.~
@49258 = ~I'll return when the vampire is destroyed.~
@49259 = ~I think there's one in... in Isabella's pack. I'll get it for you.~
@49260 = ~I don't want to leave Isabella's body. Please, just find the vampire's corpse and stake it.~
@49261 = ~Luck be with you.~
@49262 = ~Hello again! Hope your travels find you well.~
@49263 = ~You certainly deserve a reward, I can't argue with that. Unfortunately, the shield I found went missing earlier. You wouldn't know anything about that, would you?~
@49264 = ~I took it. It didn't belong to you.~
@49265 = ~I have no idea what you're talking about.~
@49266 = ~The shield is mine now.~
@49267 = ~I'm not of a mind to worry about it. The vampire's dead. That's all that matters.~
@49268 = ~Oh, hello.~ [BD49268]
@49269 = ~How are you holding up, Ikros?~
@49270 = ~That's good, I... I'm sorry. I'm still a bit stunned.~
@49271 = ~Thanks. Now turn over the shield, as Isabella agreed.~
@49272 = ~Still a bit stunned. I can't—I can't believe she's gone... Excuse me, please. I need a moment. Forgive me.~ [BD49272]
