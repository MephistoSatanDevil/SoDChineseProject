@44852 = ~It's these new glasses, man. They're supposed to let me see, like, who I really am. Like inside my SOUL.~ [BD44852]
@44853 = ~Where did you get these glasses?~
@44854 = ~Like, whoa. ~
@44855 = ~That seems unlikely.~

@44857 = ~AAAAH!~ [BD44857]
@44858 = ~But all I see is invisible monsters and ghosts and stuff. It's making me feel like, really SURROUNDED, y'know? By my surroundings?~ [BD44858]
@44859 = ~So these enchanted spectacles let you see invisible creatures? ~
@44860 = ~I get it, man. I totally get it.~

@44862 = ~YEAAAAAAGH!~ [BD44862]
@44863 = ~I'm starting to freak out, man.~ [BD44863]
@44864 = ~Why don't you take the spectacles off?~
@44865 = ~Let me take a look at them, man.~
@44866 = ~Just give me the spectacles, you gibbering jackanapes.~
@44867 = ~I shall leave you to your madness, then.~
@44868 = ~WHOA.~ [BD44868]

@44871 = ~Thanks, man.~
@44872 = ~Gladly, if it will stop your blathering.~
@44873 = ~Everything's so much clearer now! Maybe you're the one who should be on a vision quest. I'm laying off for a while. ~ [BD44873]
@44874 = ~That's probably a good idea.~
@44875 = ~Chill out for a bit.~
@44876 = ~Yes, give your addled mind a rest.~
@44877 = ~Oh, and the giant gnome said the glasses can, like, PULL spirits into reality a few times. So be careful! You don't want to drag a screaming modron or gith into the Prime for a hangout. ~ [BD44877]
@44878 = ~Good to know. Thanks, Zaviak.~
@44879 = ~Heavy.~
@44880 = ~How you survived this long I have no idea.~

@44883 = ~I had a question about these spectacles.~
@44884 = ~It's going, man. It's going.~
@44885 = ~Worse now that I've encountered you again.~
@44886 = ~You know I'm not a man, right?~
@44887 = ~"Man" doesn't mean, like, MAN, man. It means, like... dude.~ [BD44887]
@44888 = ~Well, that clears that up. ~
@44889 = ~Hehehe, you're all right, man. What can I do for you? ~ [BD44889]
@44890 = ~What exactly will I be looking at when I put on these spectacles?~
@44891 = ~You said I could pull creatures into the Prime Material Plane? Is that, like, true?~
@44892 = ~Nothing right now.~
@44893 = ~All right, so like, our plane overlaps with all these other planes, right? Overlaps isn't really the right word; it's more like... circles. In other circles. It's complicated, Anyway, the other planes have creatures on them overlapping US. That's what you see.~ [BD44893]
@44894 = ~And you said I could pull creatures into this plane?~
@44895 = ~Thanks, Zaviak.~
@44896 = ~Yeah, like our reality is called the Prime Material Plane, and the other planes have other names. You can pull a creature from its plane to ours, but they might not like it, man. Think about it, you know, fish out of water, you know? Only maybe less with the fish dying and more them, like, killing you. Or not.~ [BD44896]
@44897 = ~What exactly do these spectacles reveal?~
@44898 = ~Thanks, Zaviak.~

@44906 = ~Peace, creature. I want only to talk.~
@44907 = ~I can't say for certain I'm tasty, but I know for sure that all my treasure belongs to ME.~
@44908 = ~If it's a fight you want, I'll gladly give it to you.~
@44909 = ~Tremble before me, foolish <PRO_RACE>! I'll tear you apart and drain your delicious magicks dry!~
@44910 = ~You can try if you must, but know that I won't hesitate to defend myself.~
@44911 = ~Big words from an ugly floating blob.~
@44912 = ~You threaten me? That's a mistake. You're about to learn how great a mistake it is.~
@44913 = ~If it's magic items you want, you can find much more than I have to the north.~
@44914 = ~RAARGH! ~
@44915 = ~What's that? More succulent magic to feast on?~
@44916 = ~North of here, there's a camp full of soldiers with magic weapons and magic-users readying for a fight. It's a veritable buffet.~

@44931 = ~What do you want to know? ~
@44932 = ~Who are you?~
@44933 = ~Where did you come from?~
@44934 = ~What you'll be giving me as a reward for saving your life.~

@44950 = ~What business did you have on the Elemental Plane of Earth?~
@44951 = ~I have another question.~

@44954 = ~Aye, I expected as much. No one does anything for free. Take my ring; it'll serve you well.~ [BD44954]

@44956 = ~Thanks. I had a few questions for you.~
@44957 = ~Hand it over and begone.~

@44973 = ~Your happiness is as immaterial as the place you call home. What can you do for me?~
@44974 = ~I should write a song about this. The djinni brought to the Prime and all the wonders he sees here!~
@44975 = ~I am a merchant and often collect items from various planes. Perhaps I could show you some of my wares?~ [BD44975]

@44987 = ~Let's see, how did it go? There once was a powerful djinni... ~
@44988 = ~Yes? ~
@44989 = ~Whose scent was remarkably keen... ~
@44990 = ~Go on! ~
@44991 = ~When he wrinkled his nose and he smelled his own toes, then he turned from bright blue to lime-green. ~

@44993 = ~My apologies, it was the only one I knew.~

@44995 = ~You got what you asked for.~

@45007 = ~Yes, I am the one responsible.~
@45008 = ~Maybe I did, maybe I didn't.~
@45009 = ~ 'Twas my power that drew you here, monster.~
@45010 = ~You play a dangerous game, drawing the powers of other planes to you, heedless of their will. And not a protective circle in sight! I should tear you to bloody shreds.~
@45011 = ~There's no need for violence. I didn't mean to upset you.~
@45012 = ~Obviously, I wouldn't summon a creature so powerful as you without SOME way to protect myself.~
@45013 = ~Try it and I'll skin you alive, cat.~
@45014 = ~Oh, there IS a need. I dislike being dragged from my home. Why would you do such a foolish thing?~
@45015 = ~These spectacles allow me to see creatures in other planes and pull them here. I didn't realize you were so dangerous.~
@45016 = ~I'm on a vision quest. A crazy man gave me these glasses that draw spirits to me. It's not working out at the moment.~
@45017 = ~I wanted to see what I could release with the power of these spectacles.~
@45018 = ~Mmmm, I don't think you can hurt me. And I'm certain I don't like being dragged from my home. What inspired you to such foolishness?~
@45019 = ~These spectacles allow me to see creatures in other planes and pull them here. I didn't realize you were so dangerous.~
@45020 = ~I'm on a vision quest. A crazy guy gave me these glasses to draw spirits to me. It's not working out at the moment.~
@45021 = ~I wanted to see what I could release with the power of these spectacles.~
@45022 = ~So you used this item with no idea the danger you would unleash. Hah! You make me laugh, mortal.~
@45023 = ~So you used this item with no idea of the danger you would unleash. Hah! You make me laugh. Since you amuse me—a rare thing for a mortal to do—I'll give you a chance to live.~ [BD45023]
@45024 = ~What sort of chance?~
@45025 = ~It's a riddle, isn't it? I know it. It's a riddle.~
@45026 = ~I need no favors from you, fiend. I'll destroy you now and end this.~
@45027 = ~So be it!~
@45028 = ~Enough! This game no longer entertains. I shall go and seek another, one with less... tenacious... competition. Fare thee well, mortal.~
@45029 = ~I'll ask you a riddle. Solve it and I'll leave peacefully. Fail, and I rip you limb from limb.~ [BD45029]
@45030 = ~Ask your riddle, then.~
@45031 = ~I think I'd rather just kill you.~
@45032 = ~Would you rather I devour you now? ~
@45033 = ~No, no. Riddle's fine.~
@45034 = ~I think I'd rather just kill you.~
@45035 = ~Listen closely. Armed soldiers sleep the winter through but waken in the spring. They carry their pikes pointed behind but deliver quite a sting.~ [BD45035]
@45036 = ~Armed soldiers sleep the winter through but waken in the spring. They carry their pikes pointed behind but deliver quite a sting.~
@45037 = ~Rank on rank they swarm the land, their yellow coats a-gleam. They scatter wide but all fly home when they defend the Queen.~
@45038 = ~Rank on rank they swarm the land, their yellow coats agleam. They scatter wide, but all fly home when they defend the queen. What is this army?~ [BD45038]
@45039 = ~The crusade, led by Caelar the queen?~
@45040 = ~The warriors of the Monastery of the Yellow Rose?~
@45041 = ~Bees?~
@45042 = ~Edwin, any ideas?~
@45043 = ~Dynaheir, any ideas?~
@45044 = ~I don't know.~
@45045 = ~Mmmm, let me think. Of course, it's so obvious! The answer is BEES!~ [BD45045]
@45046 = ~Mine thoughts turn to the swarming of bees in the spring.~ [BD45046]
@45047 = ~You do not disappoint, mortal. This has been an amusing diversion after all. I will depart now. Take more care what you summon in the future.~ [BD45047]
@45048 = ~I'm glad I could be of service.~
@45049 = ~I enjoyed it too. Especially the bits where you didn't threaten to eat me.~
@45050 = ~I'm not here for your amusement.~
@45051 = ~I must depart now, mortal. Be more cautious about what you summon in the future.~
@45052 = ~Wrong answer, mortal. And now I feast!~ [BD45052]
