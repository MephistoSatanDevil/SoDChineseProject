@45099 = ~Ssssssss... ~
@45100 = ~Can you understand me?~
@45101 = ~Hiss?~
@45102 = ~Ah, an evil shadow. Just what I wanted to destroy.~
@45103 = ~Yessssss... ~
@45104 = ~What do you want, shadow?~
@45105 = ~This is a riveting conversation. Is there anything I can help you with?~
@45106 = ~It's time for you to die now.~
@45107 = ~Void... the ssspace between the ssstars...~
@45108 = ~I see. You're nothing but a creature of nihilism.~
@45109 = ~As much as I'm enjoying this little chat, I have to get going. And that means you must die.~
@45110 = ~If it's death you crave, there's a pack of bugbears down the tunnel there you might want to have a word with.~
@45111 = ~As I freed you, perhaps you would be willing to do me a service? Say, destroying the bugbears at the end of the tunnel?~
@45112 = ~Viconia, can you speak to this creature?~
@45113 = ~Your time is at an end, shadow.~
@45114 = ~Shadows are sacred to the Nightsinger. I shall try.~ [BD45114]
@45115 = ~It is a creature of violence that seeks to destroy the living. I can direct it against the bugbears if you wish.~ [BD45115]
@45116 = ~Yes, please.~
@45117 = ~No, I will kill this thing myself.~
@45118 = ~I... I am free. After so long... ~ [BD45118]
@45119 = ~Greetings. My name is <CHARNAME>. You are?~
@45120 = ~You can thank me for that.~
@45121 = ~I expect a reward for freeing you.~
@45122 = ~I am Zhadroth. You are the one who released me from my eternal imprisonment in the far realm?~ [BD45122]
@45123 = ~I suppose I am. What were you imprisoned for?~
@45124 = ~I like to think of myself as a traveling liberator, freer of the unjustly imprisoned. You WERE unjustly imprisoned, right?~
@45125 = ~You can thank me with gold.~
@45126 = ~The reasons are of no consequence. What matters is that I can now wreak my vengeance on those who locked me away.~ [BD45126]
@45127 = ~That sounds unpleasant.~
@45128 = ~I'm not sure this was the best idea I ever had.~
@45129 = ~I know what you are, lich. My training taught me to deal with creatures like you!~
@45130 = ~Wreak your vengeance after you've rewarded me.~
@45131 = ~I have but one item upon my person, but you may have it. You have my thanks, liberator.~ [BD45131]
@45132 = ~I have killed more priests than I can count, mortal! You will be the next!~ [BD45132]
@45133 = ~Meddler! Freer of evil! Destroyer of the balance! ~ [BD45133]
@45134 = ~Who are you, spirit? ~
@45135 = ~This is about Zhadroth, isn't it?~
@45136 = ~Out of my way or I'll show you how destructive I can be.~
@45137 = ~For centuries, I watched over the lich's prison. In one moment, you annihilated everything I secured for so long.~ [BD45137]
@45138 = ~Forgive me, please. I didn't mean to destroy your work.~
@45139 = ~You're not a very good guard, are you? You might have set up an alarm or something.~
@45140 = ~What of it?~
@45141 = ~Zhadroth is no more. After freeing the lich, I slew him and ended his evil.~
@45142 = ~Now Zhadroth is free to wreak havoc on the land. Thousands will die! This is YOUR fault, and you will pay!~ [BD45142]
@45143 = ~You lie! Zhadroth is too powerful to be slain by such as you. ~ [BD45143]
@45144 = ~Zhadroth is no more? Then I am free as well. Thank you, good hero. Take my weapon as a reward. I need it no longer.~ [BD45144]
@45145 = ~Now we are even, liberator. But should you ever ascend, please look kindly upon the pain I will soon inflict upon the betrayers of H'Catha.~ [BD45145]
@45146 = ~Aaah! The essence of evil suffuses this place!~
@45147 = ~I don't think you belong here.~
@45148 = ~This is one of the Nine Hells. Pure evil is what it does.~
@45149 = ~Stop your wailing.~
@45150 = ~Aaah! The essence of evil suffuses this place! What fiend would subject me to such an infernal pit?~
@45151 = ~I didn't mean to. You see, I have these magic spectacles...~
@45152 = ~I didn't realize you were an angel. If you want to leave, you're free to go. I sure can't stop you.~
@45153 = ~Fair deva, I am a holy warrior. I swear on my soul I meant no harm in calling you here. Your agony shames me.~
@45154 = ~One that is amused to see you flutter about so pitifully.~
@45155 = ~Fool! It is too late!~
@45156 = ~Ah! That I should be soiled by such base fiends as these. You! I should strike you dead for this trespass! Your ignorance insults the divine powers I serve.~
@45157 = ~I believe you. Now assist me in fighting off the denizens of this wretched place!~
@45158 = ~I sense dark power in your blood. The shadow on your soul spreads like an inky stain. You belong here, creature of darkness.~
@45159 = ~I am what I am. I'll make no apologies, least of all to you.~
@45160 = ~That's a bit harsh, isn't it?~
@45161 = ~We both belong here, radiant one. I as a ruler, you as my vassal—or a corpse!~
@45162 = ~If I must be trapped in the Hells, at least I can end your evil! ~
@45163 = ~Wait! Hold your attack and I will do the same.~ [BD45163]
@45164 = ~This had better not be a trick.~
@45165 = ~You don't seriously expect me to fall for THAT, do you?~
@45166 = ~No mercy. Die, demon!~
@45167 = ~I thought you were intruders in my home, but this... this isn't the Abyss. This is Avernus!~ [BD45167]
@45168 = ~And that makes a difference, does it?~
@45169 = ~You're one sharp demon. Only took a blow to the head for you to notice where you were.~
@45170 = ~Make your point, if you have one.~
@45171 = ~Heh heh... I could not have planned this better myself! I thank you, mortal, for giving me access to the inner demesne of a hated rival.~ [BD45171]
@45172 = ~Don't be so quick to thank me. I'm not going to let you leave. You're a demon and therefore must die.~
@45173 = ~Always happy to have a fiend's gratitude.~
@45174 = ~I don't do favors for demons.~
@45175 = ~I shall take my leave of you. There are many plans I have to foil, many preparations to ruin. Take this blade as my gift. Treat it well. A boon from my kind is rare.~ [BD45175]
@45176 = ~Die if you wish. I will enjoy devouring your soul.~ [BD45176]
@45177 = ~Pike that! I'm no full-on fiend, bound by my blood. I can be good or evil as I like.~ [BD45177]
@45178 = ~Stay by the door and ensure we're not disturbed.~
@45179 = ~Keep an eye on the hall, Sallo.~
@45180 = ~Man the door and don't let anyone in while we're talking.~
@45181 = ~Lord Maxwell,

The time has come to take action. Araya agrees with me that we can't risk openly challenging the Grand Dukes of Baldur's Gate. They wield too much influence, and their motives cannot be trusted. I've heard disturbing whispers regarding the killer of Sarevok, whom the dukes are now in league with. How can we trust them to lead our city and reap the profits thereof? Meet us at the Three Old Kegs on the morrow and we'll decide on a plan of action. Elric should also be joining us. Burn this letter.

–Therton~
@45182 = ~It's nothing.~
@45183 = ~If you say so. I'll follow you outside when you're ready to leave.~
@45184 = ~You're back. Excellent.~
@45185 = ~<CHARNAME> is back.~
@45186 = ~Nathbaera~
@45187 = ~Belegarm~
@45188 = ~Quartermaster~
@45189 = ~Ah. You've returned, Sallo.~
@45190 = ~Therton, the muscle is here.~
@45191 = ~Oh dear, I really don't handle these matters. Therton? Could you...?~
@45192 = ~Yes, I'm here.~
@45193 = ~I never said I was Sallo. ~
@45194 = ~Delenda~
@45195 = ~Bartleby~
