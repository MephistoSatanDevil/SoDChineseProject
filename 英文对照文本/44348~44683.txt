@44354 = ~Sailors from two crews sit in the bar, drinking. One of the members of one crew, Autinn from "Chionthar's Son," hurls insults at the crew of "Amnish Delight." Dialogue fires as soon as the player enters the room. ~
@44355 = ~The Amnian Delight is the ricketiest tub I ever seen! You hear me over there?~
@44356 = ~What, too good to talk to the crew of Chionthar's Son? Gutless landlubbers!~
@44357 = ~I'd never sail under that spineless wretch that stands at your helm!~
@44358 = ~Easy there. We don't want any trouble.~
@44359 = ~Ah, that crew's spineless! They don't even care when I say their captain is a doddering half-wit who don't know port from starboard!~
@44360 = ~Hey, turn your ship into a barge and haul all that rancid wheat right back to Amn!~
@44361 = ~Now take it easy there, sir. We go to some lengths to enforce the peace here.~
@44362 = ~That ship of theirs shouldn't just be hauling garbage, it should be towed away AS garbage!~
@44363 = ~That's IT. Get 'em!~
@44364 = ~Stop, stop! Everyone calm down. You there—you're the hero of Baldur's Gate! ~
@44365 = ~That title is a bit grand. I only did what anyone would have done.~
@44366 = ~You have me confused me with someone else, friend.~
@44367 = ~What if I am?~
@44368 = ~I'm sure of it, it's you! Can you help settle this? I don't want to have to call Ithtyl and the other enforcers.~

@44372 = ~This isn't your business, stranger. Keep out of it.~
@44373 = ~A fight would damage the bar. People could get hurt. At least take this outside.~
@44374 = ~Why fight when you can drink? That's all I'm saying. Let's sit down and have another round.~
@44375 = ~I'm making it my business. Stand down.~
@44376 = ~Hey, I know you. You're the one everyone's talking about.~
@44377 = ~I know you, "hero." You were mixed up with Sarevok. Everyone's talking about it. Why should we listen to you, hey? You might have the darkest soul in here.~
@44378 = ~You don't know what you're talking about.~
@44379 = ~And you might have the ugliest face, but you don't see me going on about it.~
@44380 = ~Go back to your cups before you say something you'll truly regret.~
@44381 = ~I have a black soul indeed, blacker than you can imagine. I have seen darkness. It flows like blood through my veins.~
@44382 = ~I ended Sarevok's threat. My soul's no darker than anyone's here.~
@44383 = ~There's no talking to a lackwit like Autinn. Violence is all he understands.~

@44385 = ~What about another drink? Would he understand that?~
@44386 = ~We've much in common then, he and I.~

@44388 = ~Enough with the words! It's punching time!~
@44389 = ~Everyone, calm down. Let's try to deal with this like civilized folk.~
@44390 = ~I'll give you a choice: Sit down or bleed out. I can take everyone in this bar if I have to.~
@44391 = ~None of this matters anyway. While you've been arguing, your ships have been robbed. You're all in the same boat now—looking for work.~
@44392 = ~Why don't we all listen to a song of friendship and camaraderie on the sea? That'll improve your mood.~
@44393 = ~Whoa, whoa, wait a moment. I didn't—I mean, I heard some stories about you, but that's all, just, you know, some stories.~
@44394 = ~Sarevok was nothing compared to me. Let me show you what I'm capable of.~
@44395 = ~Run for it!~
@44396 = ~Prove it. Lend us a hand against the "Amnian Delight's" crew.~
@44397 = ~I'm with you. Let's get them!~

@44401 = ~Nor do I. Let's get outta here!~
@44402 = ~Reasonable, aye, but I'm also a crewmember of "The Amnian Delight." I'm gonna beat this codfish cuddler into the ground. How about you give me a hand?~
@44403 = ~Aye, all right. Let's get him!~
@44404 = ~Is a fight worth it? Your captain will likely find out, and I doubt <PRO_HESHE> will be pleased.~

@44407 = ~What?~
@44408 = ~My underworld contacts told me thieves disguised as dock workers "unloaded" the Chionthar's Son's cargo right into their own wagons.~
@44409 = ~You lie!~
@44410 = ~Aye, that's what you'd like to think. Another team distracted the Amnian Delight's crew with a false drowning. They used a portable hole to load up all the wheat and snuck out.~
@44411 = ~Back to the Delight! We have to find that wheat!~
@44412 = ~Let's go, mates! Maybe we can catch those thieves!~
@44413 = ~Ugh. All this cameraderie makes my stomach heave like a ship in a storm.~
@44414 = ~I came to this tavern for peace and quiet, not to hear ill-tuned caterwauling.~
@44415 = ~The stranger's right. We don't have time to engage in petty brawls.~
@44416 = ~Ahhh, none of you have any spirit. Come on, mates. Let's look elsewhere for fun.~

@44427 = ~How you got those sailors to stand down I couldn't tell you. Take this bit of gold as thanks. Glad I didn't have to call Ithtyl down here!~
@44428 = ~Keep your gold; I'm just happy I was able to help.~
@44429 = ~Much appreciated.~
@44430 = ~This is all you have? I suppose it will do.~
@44431 = ~Have a good <DAYNIGHTALL>, <PRO_SIRMAAM>.~
@44432 = ~You're too generous, <PRO_SIRMAAM>! Here, have a drink on the house!~
@44433 = ~We certainly made that blowhard eat his words, didn't we? ~
@44434 = ~He'll think twice about insulting people in bars again.~
@44435 = ~He needs to spend less time thinking up stupid insults and more time swinging his fists.~
@44436 = ~It took all my resolve not to kill him.~
@44437 = ~I couldn't have done it without you. Take this mace as a thank-you gift.~
@44438 = ~You're most welcome.~
@44439 = ~It was a pleasure to help such a beautiful woman.~
@44440 = ~Give it here.~
@44441 = ~Fare well.~
@44442 = ~Oh, thank you! I... I must be going now. Perhaps if we meet again, we can talk more.~
@44443 = ~Ha! We showed those garbage-haulers a good time, didn't we? ~
@44444 = ~We certainly did!~
@44445 = ~I haven't had a fight that good in days!~
@44446 = ~They're lucky to have left this place alive.~
@44447 = ~You've done us a good turn, no mistake. Here, take this sword. Funny shape, but a good blade. ~
@44448 = ~Appreciate it, mate.~
@44449 = ~Call me anytime you need to wallop someone.~
@44450 = ~Give it here.~
@44451 = ~Smooth seas to you, mate! ~
@44452 = ~There's no doubting it. Now is the time to remove the Council of Four and take the city for ourselves—~
@44453 = ~Hush! Someone's here.~
@44454 = ~You there! This is a private room. What are you... You're <CHARNAME>, aren't you? The hero of Baldur's Gate? What are you doing here?~
@44455 = ~I couldn't help but overhear you.~
@44456 = ~You want to depose the Council of Four. I want in.~
@44457 = ~A better question is what YOU'RE doing here.~
@44458 = ~I found this letter. I thought it might be worth something to you.~
@44459 = ~Good day, then.~
@44460 = ~You're a gnomish mercenary captain? I've never heard of such a thing.~
@44461 = ~Aye, I've made a living sailin' the Sword Coast and selling my services to the highest bidder, arrrrr.~
@44462 = ~I'm as ruthless as a half-orc and clever as an elf. Don't let my size fool you.~
@44463 = ~I assure you, I'm Sallo.~
@44464 = ~Actually, you've mistaken me for someone else.~
@44465 = ~Sallo the mercenary captain? ~
@44466 = ~Aye, I've made a living sailin' the Sword Coast and selling my services to the highest bidder, arrrrr.~
@44467 = ~None other. I'm a busy < PRO_MANWOMAN> so let's get down to it.~
@44468 = ~I assure you, I'm Sallo.~
@44469 = ~Actually, you've mistaken me for someone else.~
@44470 = ~Just look at <PRO_HISHER> imposing figure! This is certainly the famed Sallo.~
@44471 = ~You are not who we expected.~
@44472 = ~I suggest we convene another time. Good day to all of you.~
@44473 = ~Well, then! Now that Sallo's here to guard us, let's get down to business. Sallo, keep an eye on the door and make sure we're not disturbed.~
@44474 = ~Wh-what? Where did you get that?~
@44475 = ~What matters is that I have it. How much will you give me for it?~
@44476 = ~Does it matter? Now give me all your money or I'll take this letter straight to the Flaming Fist.~
@44477 = ~From your pocket, obviously. I like your style, but style doesn't put a roof over my head—I'm going to need payment for this.~
@44478 = ~I don't have the patience for blackmail. It's easier to kill you all.~
@44479 = ~This is outrageous! Give that back at once.~
@44480 = ~Payment first.~
@44481 = ~Not until you give me that fat money purse at your hip.~
@44482 = ~Don't make me hurt you.~
@44483 = ~It's no use arguing, Therton. We'd best do as this ruffian demands.~
@44484 = ~Oh, very well. Here. It's all I have.~
@44485 = ~You can't intimidate us. I—I—I'll scream for the guards.~
@44486 = ~Do it and your letter will be made public. Very public.~
@44487 = ~Please do. I'll need the guards here when I expose you as traitors.~
@44488 = ~Don't make this harder than it has to be, you mewling coward.~
@44489 = ~You bore me, sir. I think I'll kill you and be done with it.~
@44490 = ~It's not worth fighting over, Theron. Give <PRO_HIMHER> your money and your boots.~
@44491 = ~Then YOU give <PRO_HIMHER> your cloak, Araya.~
@44492 = ~Fine!~
@44493 = ~For the love of the gods, Therton, can't you see the murder in <PRO_HISHER> eyes? Hand over everything you have! Here, take my dagger too!~
@44494 = ~And here's my cloak! Please, just don't hurt us!~
@44495 = ~We'll take our leave now. Never let us see your face again!~
@44496 = ~If you think we'll lay down and die without a fight, you'd best think again. Have at you!~
@44497 = ~We might as well share our thoughts, even though Eldric isn't here yet.~
@44498 = ~Late, as usual.~
@44499 = ~We CAN trust him, can't we? There's no danger he's off talking to the Council?~
@44500 = ~We can trust him completely. Even if he were betraying us, the dukes are so corrupt and incompetent they'd probably ignore him.~
@44501 = ~They're getting worse too. The guidance they give the city is truly shameful— Ah, <CHARNAME>, there you are. Did you find Eldric?~
@44502 = ~I even heard—wait a minute. Sallo! Any movement in the halls?~
@44503 = ~Everything's quiet, my lords and lady. You can speak freely.~
@44504 = ~I have everything under control. Go ahead and talk as much as you like.~
@44505 = ~None at all, you treasonous coward.~
@44506 = ~Very good. As I was saying, I even heard that the dukes are allied with Sarevok's killer!~
@44507 = ~How shocking!~
@44508 = ~Dark rumors swirl around this so-called "hero of Baldur's Gate." Clearly, we can't trust the dukes any longer.~
@44509 = ~They must be removed from power as soon as possible.~
@44510 = ~Ruling the city is a heavy burden, but it is one we must take upon ourselves if the city is to prosper.~
@44511 = ~And if we prosper as well, what's the harm in that?~
@44512 = ~Sallo! Any sign or Lord Elric yet?~
@44513 = ~Not yet, milord. Shall I go down to the common room and look for him?~
@44514 = ~No sign of him yet. I'll run down and see if he's lost.~
@44515 = ~All I see are three traitors who deserve to die.~
@44516 = ~Yes, yes. Hurry back.~
@44517 = ~That isn't Sallo! Quick, silence <PRO_HIMHER>!~
@44518 = ~I do hope Elric arrives soon.~
@44519 = ~Clandestine meetings are so exciting!~
@44520 = ~We should have arranged to have snacks available.~
@44521 = ~<CHARNAME>? What is it? You look troubled.~
@44522 = ~A plot against the Council of Four is being hatched upstairs.~
@44523 = ~Three nobles upstairs mistook me for a mercenary captain named Sallo. Strange, I know. Then they started talking about overthrowing the dukes!~
@44524 = ~Three nobles upstairs are plotting to take over the city. It makes no difference to me, but I thought you might like to know.~
@44525 = ~I found this letter upstairs. It implicates three nobles in this inn of plotting against the dukes of Baldur's Gate.~
@44526 = ~I slew three nobles upstairs. They were plotting against the city. Here, one of them was carrying this note.~
@44527 = ~These conspirators are upstairs right now? I'll summon help and take up position outside their door. You go back up and get them talking about this plot again.~
@44528 = ~Yes, and they're expecting me back any minute.~
@44529 = ~They sure are. Saying unflattering things about me too, I might add.~
@44530 = ~For the moment.~
@44531 = ~I'll summon a squad of Flaming Fist and take positions outside their door. You go back up and get them talking about their plot again. ~
@44532 = ~I understand. I'll meet you upstairs.~
@44533 = ~Very well—but make sure you and the others are ready to move as soon as the nobles reveal their plan.~
@44534 = ~If I must.~
@44535 = ~I'll be there as soon as I can.~
@44536 = ~You head back upstairs. Remember: You have to get the nobles to talk about their treasonous activities.~
@44537 = ~Oh, gods damn it...! All right. I'll round up some Flaming Fist enforcers and arrest the traitors. Thanks for looking after the city's interests. It's appreciated.~
@44538 = ~Thank you for looking after the city's interests. I appreciate your dedication.~
@44539 = ~You should've come to me before taking matters into your own hands.~
@44540 = ~I understand. I'll take more care in the future.~
@44541 = ~The nobles attacked me! I was only defending myself.~
@44542 = ~I dispense my own justice.~
@44543 = ~At any rate, it's done now. I'll alert the Flaming Fists to come and make a proper investigation.~
@44544 = ~Thanks for bringing this to my attention. I'll see that everything's taken care of.~
@44545 = ~Good, you're here. Any sign of Eldric?~
@44546 = ~Not yet, milord.~
@44547 = ~I didn't see him. You should probably continue your meeting without him.~
@44548 = ~He sent a messenger. It seems he's ill and can't make it, but he says you should proceed without him.~
@44549 = ~How inconvenient... Elric really knew the best way for us to proceed.~
@44550 = ~Yes. It's all very well to talk about our ideas, our dreams, but we need a plan of action.~
@44551 = ~Perhaps we should reschedule for when Elric is available?~
@44552 = ~I can't guarantee I'll be around for your next meeting. If you want my assistance, we need to settle this sooner than later.~
@44553 = ~Bad idea. You've already lost the better part of a night. Do you want to lose the rest of it too?~
@44554 = ~I've heard rumors that Lord Elric is very difficult to schedule around. He's always late and misses half his appointments.~
@44555 = ~We may not have an opportunity like this again for some time...~
@44556 = ~Fine. Forget Eldric. There are things we can do, events we can start in motion without his immediate assistance.~
@44557 = ~We should pool our resources and undercut the trade business of... you know who. That will put us in a strong position.~
@44558 = ~And what shall I do?~
@44559 = ~If it's shipping lines you want disrupted, I know people who can make it happen.~
@44560 = ~"You know who"? Seriously?~
@44561 = ~We speak of one of the dukes of Baldur's Gate. Undermining his resource base is one step in our plan. ~
@44562 = ~And what is my role in all this?~
@44563 = ~If it's shipping lines you want to disrupt, I know people who can make it happen.~
@44564 = ~I see. If you've the coin, I've the people to help you out.~
@44565 = ~The dregs of the Sword Coast fill our streets. Demand for goods is rising, and prices will follow—we'll see to it. You will speak out about the Council's inability to deal with the situation.~
@44566 = ~People will listen to the hero of Baldur's Gate. You will help us topple the Grand Dukes one by one. And we shall be there to take the reins of power.~
@44567 = ~Strange... that isn't like Lord Elric at all.~
@44568 = ~We're done here. We'll reunite at a later date—in a more private venue.~
@44569 = ~How dare you address us in such a manner? You think us children? How dare you?~
@44570 = ~You scared them off! You should have been more subtle. ~ [BD44570]
@44571 = ~I'm sorry, I'm not very good at deception.~
@44572 = ~This was your idea, not mine. Don't blame me if it didn't work.~
@44573 = ~Save your scorn. You wouldn't have known about the plot at all were it not for me.~
@44574 = ~Come on, let's go. We've wasted enough time here.~ [BD44574]
@44575 = ~By order of the Flaming Fist, you three are under arrest!~ [BD44575]
@44576 = ~What? Don't you know who I am?~
@44577 = ~I do, and I'm disappointed to see you embroiled in this sordid plot, milord.~
@44578 = ~We heard everything. You're all in a great deal of trouble.~
@44579 = ~It was all Araya's fault! She put us up to this!~
@44580 = ~WHAT? Don't listen to him; Therton's the real ringleader!~
@44581 = ~The magistrate will sort it out. As for you, <CHARNAME>, you've done us a great service. Take this, and the city's thanks.~
@44582 = ~It was an honor to serve the interests of Baldur's Gate.~
@44583 = ~As long as the city keeps rewarding me, I'll keep serving it.~
@44584 = ~I had little choice but to step in. No one else had competence enough to deal with this plot.~
@44585 = ~Please stop with the flattery, <CHARNAME>. You'll make me blush.~ [BD44585]
@44586 = ~You did good work tonight, <CHARNAME>. Thank you.~ [BD44586]
@44587 = ~Uggggh...~
@44588 = ~Are you all right?~
@44589 = ~Hello? CAN YOU HEAR ME? ~
@44590 = ~What a disgusting sight. On your feet.~
@44591 = ~Better people than you have tried to rouse Sallo when <PRO_HESHE>'s on a bender. Can't be done.~
@44592 = ~I don't think I've seen anyone this drunk before.~
@44593 = ~Looks like this Sallo knows how to have a good time.~
@44594 = ~A pathetic display.~
@44595 = ~Yep, that's our Sallo. Come to think of it, you two look an awful lot alike. Maybe you're long-lost twins?~
@44596 = ~I don't need any more surprise relatives, thanks.~
@44597 = ~Oh, come now, I'm MUCH more attractive.~
@44598 = ~I'm no relation to this drunken pig.~
@44599 = ~Good ol' Sallo.~
@44600 = ~What are you doing in here? This is a private room!~
@44601 = ~Sorry, I didn't know this room was occupied. I'll leave immediately.~
@44602 = ~You should post a guard if you want to keep people out. It's customary around these parts.~
@44603 = ~I go where I wish.~
@44604 = ~My deepest apologies. I heard there was a noblewoman here who might be interested in my anti-aging magic, but a beauty like yours needs no help from me.~
@44605 = ~I didn't mean to intrude. I heard there was a woman of surpassing beauty in this room. The stories did not do you justice.~
@44606 = ~I demand you leave at ONCE! ~
@44607 = ~I didn't mean to offend you. I'll leave immediately.~
@44608 = ~I'm going, I'm going.~
@44609 = ~I'm just going to have a look around first, if I may.~
@44610 = ~Begone!~
@44611 = ~This is a private chamber, and I am a lady! I demand you leave at once!~
@44612 = ~I meant no offense. I'll leave immediately.~
@44613 = ~I'm going, I'm going.~
@44614 = ~I'll leave when I choose, not before.~
@44615 = ~BARTLEBY!~
@44616 = ~Anti-aging?~
@44617 = ~I can cast spells to reduce the signs of aging. I see you have little need of such things, except for... well, perhaps...~
@44618 = ~I misspoke. I have to be going.~
@44619 = ~Perhaps what? What is it? ~
@44620 = ~You have a few very fine lines... laugh-lines, I call them, around the corners of your eyes. I can get rid of them for a price.~
@44621 = ~How much would such a service cost? I've laughed a lot in my life.~
@44622 = ~That necklace around your throat would be sufficient payment. ~
@44623 = ~Wait. You're trying to trick me, I can tell!~
@44624 = ~My necklace? Well... I suppose it's worth it. Here you are.~
@44625 = ~Here is the spell I promised, madam. When next you awake, your laugh-lines will be gone.~
@44626 = ~Oh, thank you!~
@44627 = ~Don't think you can charm me. I've dealt with your type before.~
@44628 = ~Charm you, my lady? I wanted only to look upon your exquisite face. You've made me very happy.~
@44629 = ~Very well, I'll be going.~
@44630 = ~It's a blessing and a curse, this beauty of mine. You may stay a moment if you like.~
@44631 = ~I wish I could stay forever and gaze into your eyes. My heart aches at the thought of leaving you. ~
@44632 = ~I haven't heard such lovely words in a long time. Would that you could stay forever...~
@44633 = ~Perhaps I could leave my words behind. That necklace you're wearing—may I borrow it? I'll inscribe a love poem on it for you. ~
@44634 = ~Take it, dear one. Bring it back with words of love upon it. ~
@44635 = ~You again? You are both ignorant and oafish. Leave my room immediately!~
@44636 = ~I'm sorry, it was an accident.~
@44637 = ~And you still haven't learned how to post a guard. I'd look into that if I were you.~
@44638 = ~Words alone won't keep me from going where I will.~
@44639 = ~My deepest apologies. I heard there was a noblewoman here who might be interested in my anti-aging magic, but a beauty like yours needs no help from me.~
@44640 = ~I didn't mean to intrude, but I heard there was a woman of surpassing beauty in this room. The stories did not do you justice.~
@44641 = ~I can and I will. Now leave. ~
@44642 = ~I didn't mean to offend you. I'm leaving.~
@44643 = ~I'm going, I'm going.~
@44644 = ~I'll leave when I'm good and ready.~
@44645 = ~Get. Out.~
@44646 = ~BARTLEBY!~
@44647 = ~I warned you twice not to disturb me. I'll not do so again.~
@44648 = ~Honestly, this is just a misunderstanding. All these rooms look alike.~
@44649 = ~Calm down. Have a glass of wine, maybe.~
@44650 = ~I'd think again before threatening me.~
@44651 = ~Yes, yes, Delenda. I heard you—the entire inn heard you. What is it?~
@44652 = ~A misunderstanding, nothing more.~
@44653 = ~I was having a look around the inn, nothing more. No need to wake the place up.~
@44654 = ~This doesn't concern you.~
@44655 = ~You're supposed to be my bodyguard, Bartleby. Do your job! This RUFFIAN refuses to leave.~
@44656 = ~I'm truly sorry for upsetting you. I'll leave.~
@44657 = ~I go where I please. Interfere with me at your own peril.~
@44658 = ~I'm done here anyway.~
@44659 = ~A bit late for that. What do you mean, upsettin' a lady like this? I've half a mind to cut you in twain.~
@44660 = ~There's no need for violence. I'm going.~
@44661 = ~Half a mind is about all you've got, from the sounds of it. I'm leaving, all right?~
@44662 = ~I've dealt with worse than you. Raise your hand to me and you'll be one on the floor.~
@44663 = ~When the haze of battle consumes me, I destroy all who stand before me. Would you join the fallen?~
@44664 = ~Attack me at your peril. My years of training make me a warrior without equal.~
@44665 = ~I have gazed into oblivion and taken strength from it. Stand aside or face the darkness I have mastered.~
@44666 = ~Go quick, then, before I change my mind about teaching you some manners.~
@44667 = ~Look, the lady hired me for a bodyguard, right? An' that's what I'm doing—tryin' to, anyway. You're better at this than me I can tell.~
@44668 = ~What are you waiting for, Bartleby? Attack <PRO_HIMHER>!~
@44669 = ~My life's worth more than what you pay, ma'am. YOU fight <PRO_HIMHER>!~
@44670 = ~Coward! Wait for me!~
@44671 = ~Hee hee, this'll be fun. I ain't whupped anyone in a while!~
@44672 = ~My love, it is torture to see your face and know we cannot be together.~
@44673 = ~I can feel the magic working!~
@44674 = ~What's going on up here? What's all that noise?~
@44675 = ~A misunderstanding. It's over now.~
@44676 = ~Nothing you have to worry about. ~
@44677 = ~I don't answer to you.~
@44678 = ~Is that man DEAD? Did you kill someone?~
@44679 = ~It was an accident, but I take responsibility.~
@44680 = ~He attacked me. I had little choice but to defend myself.~
@44681 = ~Think twice before taking that tone with me.~
@44682 = ~You're lucky you're the hero of Baldur's Gate and have the Flaming Fist at your back. Ordinarily, we never tolerate violence here.~
@44683 = ~That's what they are! They found Sarevok's journal—it reveals the truth, but the Council of Four wants to keep it a secret!~
