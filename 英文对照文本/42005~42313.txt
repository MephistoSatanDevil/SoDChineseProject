@42005 = ~Not the most enticing offer I've had in my life. But some time away from the city—and its ferret-faced, mask-wearing libertine elf swine citizens—might be just what I need. Just what I need... Very well. I accept your invitation.~ [BD42005]
@42006 = ~Safana says she'll meet me at the Ducal Palace tomorrow. I'm not sure I believe her. She doesn't strike me as the most reliable of collaborators.~
@42007 = ~Unknowable Horror~
@42008 = ~What is it you want now? ~ [BD42008]
@42009 = ~Nothing more than to talk with you, dear lady.~
@42010 = ~I thought we might talk.~
@42011 = ~You deserve better company than the duergar. Would you consider joining me?~
@42012 = ~I want nothing from you, drow.~
@42013 = ~Talk, and nothing more? I know what men want from me. ~ [BD42013]
@42014 = ~You don't know what this man wants from you.~
@42015 = ~I want nothing you don't.~
@42016 = ~You think too much of yourself—and too little of me. Farewell.~
@42017 = ~We have nothing to talk about. ~ [BD42017]
@42018 = ~We do. I would have you by my side.~
@42019 = ~Don't tell me you prefer Hammerlust's company to mine.~
@42020 = ~As you wish. Farewell.~
@42021 = ~I want nothing from you. ~ [BD42021]
@42022 = ~Strength is not only inside, but also in the strength of those who walk beside you—not over you, as Hammerlust would.~
@42023 = ~Give me the chance to prove you wrong. Join me.~
@42024 = ~Then enjoy the duergar's company, drow. You deserve each other.~
@42025 = ~Me? Join you? That would drive Pfaug mad. ~
@42026 = ~Me? Join you? That would drive Pfaug mad.~ [BD42026]
@42027 = ~Then you're in luck. Nothing is exactly what you shall receive.~ [BD42027]
@42028 = ~Pfaug is crude. But honest in his intentions. Can you say the same?~ [BD42028]
@42029 = ~Farewell.~ [BD42029]
@42030 = ~别对我指手画脚。你不会喜欢后果的。~ [BD42030]
@42031 = ~Join me and I'd not have to guess at your thoughts.~
@42032 = ~As you wish. Farewell.~
@42033 = ~Don't give me orders. You'll like that even less.~
@42034 = ~Oh? And what is that? ~ [BD42034]
@42035 = ~As I said: the pleasure of your company. Leave that dwarf to walk his fool's road and join me.~
@42036 = ~Nothing. I look upon you and see nothing, feel nothing—what is there to want?~
@42037 = ~Begone, then. I grow weary of your voice. ~ [BD42037]
@42038 = ~Oy! "Hero"! I'll have words wi'you.~ [BD42038]
@42039 = ~What can I do for you, Master Hammerlust?~
@42040 = ~Any particular words? Or shall we just select them randomly? Water. Xylophone. Crepuscular. Oh, that's a good one.~
@42041 = ~No. You won't.~
@42042 = ~Y'think ye're funny, do ye? ~
@42043 = ~Forgive me. I see you're in no mood for humor. What can I do for you?~
@42044 = ~I have my moments.~
@42045 = ~No. I think you're funny.~
@42046 = ~Y'stole me feldurkin' drow! Give 'er back, or by Abbathor I'll split ye in two, crown to crotch!~
@42047 = ~You think me a possession, Pfaug? Can it be you are even more stupid than I thought?~ [BD42047]
@42048 = ~...Whut?~
@42049 = ~Begone. I want nothing more to do with you.~ [BD42049]
@42050 = ~Y'stinkin' worm, I should have yer head off for that! Y'stole me bluddy drow! Give 'er back, or by Abbathor I'll split ye in two, crown to crotch!~ [BD42050]
@42051 = ~Whud're ye lookin' at? ~ [BD42051]
@42052 = ~Forgive me, friend. I was just wondering how it is you come to serve the Flaming Fist.~
@42053 = ~I wasn't looking at any particular thing—just looking around in general.~
@42054 = ~I was looking at you. Is that a problem?~
@42055 = ~I dun't like bein' looked at in general. Or specific. Do yer gazin' in someone else's direction.~ [BD42055]
@42056 = ~Yer good luck, that's how. I heard the Argent wench wuz offerin' good gold fer mercenaries an' wuz in the Gate makin' me way north when I, ah, had a little trouble wi' a halfling who'd fled the High Moor.~
@42057 = ~Yeah it's a problem. I'll let it go this time. Don't let it happen again.~
@42058 = ~Well met, my friend. And how does this <DAYNIGHTALL> find you?~
@42059 = ~Well, thanks.~
@42060 = ~Uneasy.~
@42061 = ~My thoughts are my own. Leave me to them.~
@42062 = ~I am glad to hear it. There are many depending on you to resolve the Caelar situation as you did with Sarevok.~
@42063 = ~I'll do what I can, but I'm just one <PRO_MANWOMAN>.~
@42064 = ~They best prepare for disappointment, then.~
@42065 = ~You make it sound as though I care what others need.~
@42066 = ~You are far more than that. As you well know.~
@42067 = ~Some elevate me, but it is their doing, not mine—I do not seek the praise of others.~
@42068 = ~What's that supposed to mean?~
@42069 = ~Do you wear a hood and frequent the palace chambers in the late hours? These questions remind me of another...~
@42070 = ~You are more than a simple adventurer now; you have become a symbol. People cheer your name and look to you for hope. 'Tis a great responsibility—a greater burden than I'd ever want to bear.~
@42071 = ~Be vigilant. I wouldn't want anything to happen to the hero of Baldur's Gate.~
@42072 = ~Understandable. Much depends on the success of our mission. Much depends on you.~
@42073 = ~No more than any other loyal servant of Baldur's Gate.~
@42074 = ~Much depends on every man and woman traveling with us. I'm just one among many.~
@42075 = ~As long as the goals of these others align with my own, victory is certain.~
@42076 = ~You are more than a simple adventurer now; you are a symbol. People cheer your name, look to you for hope. 'Tis a great responsibility—a greater burden than I'd ever want to bear.~
@42077 = ~As you wish. Mind you take care of yourself. We wouldn't want anything unfortunate to happen to the hero of Baldur's Gate.~
@42078 = ~You had best become comfortable with it. You are more than simply an adventurer now. You have become a symbol. People cheer your name and look to you for hope. 'Tis a great responsibility—a greater burden than I'd ever want to bear.~
@42079 = ~It is as you say.~
@42080 = ~Camp's set, watches too. We've been marching hard, covered a lot of ground, but we've still a ways to go. Everyone could use a rest, yourself included. Tonight might be the last full night's sleep we get; we'll be in crusader territory after we cross the bridge.~ [BD42080]
@42081 = ~We should be able to reach the Trade Way bridge from here in less than a day—after that, we'll be in the crusade's territory.~
@42082 = ~Rest if you want. I'm heading up the road a way. I don't want any surprises before we cross the Winding Water.~
@42083 = ~A full night's sleep? That's a poor reward for a long day's journey.~
@42084 = ~The Flaming Fist can handle more than this. We should keep moving until we reach Dragonspear Castle.~
@42085 = ~Sounds good. Let's go.~
@42086 = ~Mind if I join you? I do better in the city than the woods, but perhaps I can help, and maybe learn a thing or two. Bence can take care of the camp.~
@42087 = ~Yes, join me. I could use someone of your skill at my side.~
@42088 = ~I suppose I could accommodate you. I expect you to hold your own, mind.~
@42089 = ~I need to move swiftly and quietly. You are neither.~
@42090 = ~You keep on believing that, if it makes you feel better.~
@42091 = ~Be careful out there.~
@42092 = ~My people need to rest. If you truly find sleep so distasteful, there's plenty to be done in the camp. Or beyond it.~ [BD42092]
@42093 = ~My people need rest and by the gods they're going to get it. If you want to keep going, we can scout the road ahead, make sure our path to the bridge is clear. Let's go.~
@42094 = ~You want to turn back?~
@42095 = ~Caelar nearly killed me and my friend Imoen. That cannot stand.~
@42096 = ~Turning back will only cause Caelar to strike me from behind. I'll face her straight on.~
@42097 = ~From the moment Caelar made a target of me, it was too late.~
@42098 = ~I was going to scout the road ahead for any surprises. Care to join me? Something tells me you've had more experience in the wilds than I have.~
@42099 = ~Most interested. Time spent in your company always rewards.~
@42100 = ~I was about to suggest the same. And someone has to keep you out of trouble.~
@42101 = ~I'll consider it, but I'm not eager to leave camp just yet.~
@42102 = ~I guess she hasn't really left you much in the way of options, has she...~
@42103 = ~Let's go.~
@42104 = ~All right then.~
@42105 = ~Yes. Join me.~
@42106 = ~Our individual styles don't mix well, I think.~
@42107 = ~Well. All right... Let's go.~
@42108 = ~You're probably right about that.~
@42109 = ~Yeah, all right. You do that.~
@42110 = ~Your enthusiasm is contagious, <CHARNAME>.~ [BD42110]
@42111 = ~We allow this Flaming Fist harridan to accompany us? We might as well scream our weakness to the wilds.~ [BD42111]
@42112 = ~A wise move. We do not of a certainty know how far Caelar's crusaders have progressed. It is best we find out before we proceed.~
@42113 = ~Peace, <CHARNAME>. Thou takest an insult where none was intended.~
@42114 = ~The druid's right. The last thing we need is to fight amongst ourselves.~
@42115 = ~Minsc and Boo are ready to move, right Boo? Boo?~ [BD42115]
@42116 = ~Boo is asleep. No matter! Minsc is ready to move!~ [BD42116]
@42117 = ~They mock me. Me! (This cannot stand. This WILL not stand!) ~ [BD42117]
@42118 = ~Eh? What is this? Where did you come from? (Careful, Odesseiron. You can trust no one...)~ [BD42118]
@42119 = ~Edwin? Edwin Odesseiron? It's been some time since I last saw you.~
@42120 = ~What was that you were saying? Are you talking to yourself?~
@42121 = ~Where did I come from? I was right in front of you, and you nearly walked over me.~
@42122 = ~I've no patience for your arrogance, or your questions. Watch where you walk in the future or I'll find a new skull to house your worthless eyes.~
@42123 = ~I was speaking to no one—well, until now, when you interrupted my path and my thoughts. Do you not know who I am? I am Edwin Odesseiron, pride of the Red Wizards, and the greatest son of Thay.~
@42124 = ~Those of skill and talent have no use for luck; dispense your ignorance elsewhere. (But the wise will take it when it is handed to them, will they not? Yes, they will.)~ [BD42124]
@42125 = ~You challenge Thay's greatest son?~
@42126 = ~Not at all. Not until the threat of Caelar has been ended.~
@42127 = ~Thay's greatest son had best get his brothers in case a Rashemen child with a stick comes, making threats. ~
@42128 = ~Challenge? A whipping or a lesson would be closer to the truth, I think. ~
@42129 = ~Begone. The sight of you offends me.~
@42130 = ~I realize your monkey brain cannot grasp the importance of this event, so I shall simply order you to show respect—do not look upon me, do not speak to me; simply bow and step aside. Do you understand my words? A nod will do.
~
@42131 = ~We've met before, Edwin. Don't you remember?~
@42132 = ~The measure of your power and confidence indeed are... difficult to ignore. Forgive you for the trespass, but I am <CHARNAME>, traveling north to fight one who has cast aspersions upon Thay and—the family... Odesseiron, I believe?~
@42133 = ~Oh, right. I remember you now. Well, good luck to you.~
@42134 = ~Defer to you? If there is any deferring that shall occur, you shall defer to ME.~
@42135 = ~Wait—<CHARNAME>? What business brings you here? ~
@42136 = ~The crusade of Caelar Argent in the north. I intend to stop it before it spreads.~
@42137 = ~Once again, I find myself dragged into events. Caelar Argent seeks my death.~
@42138 = ~Caelar Argent tried to kill me, and now I'm trying to kill her back. Childish, yes, but in my defense, she started it.~
@42139 = ~I know not why, but Caelar Argent tried to kill me. She failed. Now she must pay for her error.~
@42140 = ~Thou runnest—or should I say waddlest—away from the Shining Lady?~ [BD42140]
@42141 = ~Edwin Odesseiron does not run, nor does he waddle, you dusky-skinned harlot!~
@42142 = ~Prepare to meet your heathen gods!~
@42143 = ~Your words would be those of a wise man. A wise man whose butt needs kicking!~ [BD42143]
@42144 = ~I'll show you suffering, you ridiculous goatherder!~
@42145 = ~Oaf? You dare insult Thay's greatest son, Edwin Odesseiron? (This simian must be taught a lesson!)~
@42146 = ~Edwin Odesseiron? Forgive me, my friend—I didn't recognize you. You were even more, er, distracted than usual.~
@42147 = ~Thay's greatest son? No wonder you fled here rather than face the mercy of a Rashemen sword.~
@42148 = ~What business finds Thay's greatest son wandering the Coast Way muttering angrily to himself?~
@42149 = ~Walk—and keep walking or you'll regret it. If you don't believe me, ask that little voice of yours what you should do.~
@42150 = ~You think Thay has anything to fear from those pea-brained chimpanzees? You know nothing. ~
@42151 = ~I jest, Edwin—but truly, do you not remember me?~
@42152 = ~One particular Thayan should be very afraid right now.~
@42153 = ~Have you met my friend the pea-brained chimpanzee?~
@42154 = ~I know nothing? A fine case of the cauldron calling the ashbin black, I see.~
@42155 = ~Aha! We have reached the part I like the best! Come here, Thayan. Your butt calls out for kicking, and Minsc shall answer that call!~ [BD42155]
@42156 = ~"Pea-brained chimpanzees," thou sayest? Here then, I've something to fling at thee, Thayan devil!~ [BD42156]
@42157 = ~I've no patience this day to teach simians their place. Pray to whatever gods you worship we do not meet again.~ [BD42157]
@42158 = ~What business finds YOU here? (Muttering, <PRO_HESHE> says? Calm yourself, Edwin, <PRO_HESHE> tries to goad you. Do not play <PRO_HISHER> game.)~
@42159 = ~The crusade of Caelar Argent in the north. I intend to stop it before it spreads.~
@42160 = ~Caelar Argent tried to kill me, and now I'm trying to kill her back. Childish, I know, but she started it. I'm <CHARNAME>, by the way.~
@42161 = ~I am <CHARNAME>. The Shining Lady tried to kill me. Obviously, she failed, and will fail a second time when I find her at Dragonspear Castle.~
@42162 = ~Thou preening cockatrice! Die!~ [BD42162]
@42163 = ~We're not here to pick fights with Thayan braggarts, <CHARNAME>. Save the venom for Caelar.~ [BD42163]
@42164 = ~For the love of the gods, save that filth for a chamberpot. You, Odess—Odie—wizard. Do you know where Caelar can be found?~ [BD42164]
@42165 = ~It seems fate has offered you to me. The Shining Lady follows me, and you seek to kill her. Our interests align—and should you fail, well, no harm is done, and I am as I was. ~
@42166 = ~Caelar's chasing you? She's near here?~
@42167 = ~I've no interest in working with you.~
@42168 = ~If you seek her head, then join me—we shall end her together.~
@42169 = ~Perhaps, perhaps not. You'll not live to see it, you swarthy knuckledragger!~
@42170 = ~She is coiled, like a serpent waiting for prey, barely a day's journey from us.~
@42171 = ~Join me, Edwin. We've much to discuss.~
@42172 = ~Now this I've GOT to see. Thanks for the information, Edwin.~
@42173 = ~That is all I need. Let us part ways—with great haste.~
@42174 = ~Did he just say Caelar?~
@42175 = ~What do you know about Caelar? Who told you about her?~
@42176 = ~Told us about what, exactly?~
@42177 = ~We are part of a larger force marching north to end Caelar's crusade. As for their leader—do you know where I can find her?~
@42178 = ~The Shining Lady tried to kill me. Now it is my turn.~
@42179 = ~Caelar, you addlepated sack of stirge droppings! What do you know of Caelar? ~
@42180 = ~I travel north to put an end to her crusade. And you?~
@42181 = ~She tried to kill me, and now I'm trying to kill her back. It's kind of childish, really, but she started it.~
@42182 = ~I am <CHARNAME>. I know not why, but the Shining Lady has targeted me for death. She will pay a heavy price for that error.~
@42183 = ~Hmmm. You go to face the Shining Lady, eh? Perhaps I shall join you.~
@42184 = ~We have a mutual enemy. She has no chance against the two of us.~
@42185 = ~If it's company you seek, you can stay at the Flaming Fist camp. I'll find you there if need be. Now begone.~
@42186 = ~Caelar? What?~
@42187 = ~Very well. I shall accompany you (for now, at least).~ [BD42187]
@42188 = ~You too? The gleaming witch has dogged my heels since I left Dragonspear Castle.~
@42189 = ~She would see thee dead? Perhaps she's not the villain we believed.~ [BD42189]
@42190 = ~You will regret this decision. (And when you come crawling back to me, begging Odesseiron to save you, I shall look down and whisper... no.)~ [BD42190]
@42191 = ~So you say. SO YOU SAY. That aside, we seem to have a common goal.~
@42192 = ~You want my respect, you can earn it, same as everyone else. We're part of a Flaming Fist caravan headed to Dragonspear to take on Caelar's crusade. What are you doing here?~
@42193 = ~What do I want? What do I WANT?! Will you listen to yourself, you screeching— (No, no, calm yourself, Odesseiron. Play nice and these ridiculous halfwits may provide you some protection from Caelar...)~
@42194 = ~Fool that you are! Feel the power of the Red Wizards unleashed!~ [BD42194]
@42195 = ~I shall follow you. (For the moment, at least.)~ [BD42195]
@42196 = ~You dismiss me as you would some moon-faced servant boy? Pray to whatever gods you worship we do not cross paths again.~ [BD42196]
@42197 = ~What? What is it you want now? (It had best be worth my time, or there will be hells to pay...) ~ [BD42197]
@42198 = ~I would speak with you, Master... Odesseiron, is it not?~
@42199 = ~It certainly isn't worth my time. Farewell, Odesseiron.~
@42200 = ~I want nothing from you, you gibbering jackal.~
@42201 = ~It is and you know it is. Now speak! ~
@42202 = ~I would know what you know of the Shining Lady.~
@42203 = ~I really just wanted to make sure I had your name correct. Thank you.~
@42204 = ~When I first saw you, you were heading away from where I seek to go—away from Caelar. Tell me, have you heard anything of her that might be useful to me?~
@42205 = ~Caelar? That glittering serpent? A curse upon her, and a curse upon the hedge magic of her lackey Hephernaan!~
@42206 = ~You've met her?~
@42207 = ~Hepher-who?~
@42208 = ~Tell me more of this Hephernaan.~
@42209 = ~I'll not speak of that treacherous witch. Just know that she is the worst of deceivers, and can under no circumstances be trusted.~ [BD42209]
@42210 = ~The "Revered Brother" Hephernaan. A wolf in a robe, but he smiles and nods well enough, and such gestures seem to please Caelar.~
@42211 = ~Fare as you will. It matters not.~ [BD42211]
@42212 = ~Talk like that tells me you want a ball of fire thrown in your face. But Edwin Odesseiron flings nothing without careful consideration—fireballs included.~
@42213 = ~Are you trying to vex me? If so, you will have to try harder than that. (But not much harder. Keep pushing...)~ [BD42213]
@42214 = ~Let us be away from here, <CHARNAME>. The stench of Thay is unbearable.~ [BD42214]
@42215 = ~Peace, mage. We've enough enemies to face without adding to the list.~ [BD42215]
@42216 = ~Hephernaan. I have heard this name spoken by many who took refuge in the halls of the Iron Throne.~ [BD42216]
@42217 = ~Tell us what you know, wizard.~ [BD42217]
@42218 = ~And why would I do that? Where is the benefit in this for me?~
@42219 = ~I'll make it worth your while. Join me.~
@42220 = ~Are you such a fool as to refuse help when your life is at stake?~
@42221 = ~The benefit lies in keeping Caelar's hand from your throat for now and ever.~
@42222 = ~Boo does not like the way the Thayan smiles. Or smells. Or looks. Actually, there is little about the Thayan Boo likes, other than the fact that someday, he will die.~ [BD42222]
@42223 = ~The barbarian seeks to provoke me. Yet his words fall short, for Edwin Odesseiron will not deign to hear his chattering semblance of words that pass for insult. I shall join you, <CHARNAME>, although I would counsel you to tighten your ape's leash.~
@42224 = ~I believe I shall join you, if only to show this scum how a gentleman of Thay comports himself.~
@42225 = ~Boo knows that Caelar is the greater threat though, surely?~
@42226 = ~Boo does...~
@42227 = ~Good. Now tell us what you know of the Shining Lady.~
@42228 = ~I know far more than you, yet only this will I share—learn deference before speaking to me again. Now begone before I lose what little patience I have left.~ [BD42228]
@42229 = ~The damnable witch seeks to build an army, one that will bow to her seeming god-spawned words. She is determined, and once she sets her course, nothing deters her. Yet it is her mind that is her own worst enemy—for she deceives herself as she deceives others.~
@42230 = ~That is all I will say regarding the witch. Begone.~ [BD42230]
@42231 = ~I would speak with you. It is a matter of import and cannot wait. It concerns Caelar and her... betrayal. When first we spoke of her, I let anger twist my words.~ [BD42231]
@42232 = ~Can it wait, Edwin? I have much on my mind at the moment.~
@42233 = ~You've changed your mind about confronting her?~
@42234 = ~How exactly did she betray you?~
@42235 = ~Cling to that fury, Edwin. Cultivate your rage. It will serve us well when we face the Shining Lady.~
@42236 = ~This is not something I care to discuss.~
@42237 = ~The betrayal... was not hers. She acted as her nature demanded. The truth of the story begins with three other Red Wizards—Rowena, Ahdzekharrin, and Vichand.~
@42238 = ~We should give careful consideration to our course. Caelar's power is great, and it grows with every passing hour.~
@42239 = ~That's all the more reason to confront her at the earliest possible opportunity.~
@42240 = ~I really don't have time for this right now, Edwin.~
@42241 = ~You would have us turn back? Flee to Baldur's Gate with our tails between our legs?~
@42242 = ~Some weeks past, we received word that Caelar Argent sought magicians to bolster her crusade. We had little interest in the patchwork theology she espouses, but she was willing to pay handsomely for our talents.~
@42243 = ~We journeyed to Dragonspear and met the Shining Lady, experiencing her fabled charisma firsthand. Vichand and Ahdzekharrin joined her on the spot.~
@42244 = ~I and Rowena were not so easily cowed. When Rowena refused to kneel before Caelar without appropriate expiation for such an indignity, she was killed by one of her lieutenants.~
@42245 = ~You stood up for your friend, I assume? You avenged her?~
@42246 = ~And you ran like a beaten dog.~
@42247 = ~You seek to avenge your fallen friend.~
@42248 = ~Eh, not precisely...~
@42249 = ~Beaten dogs cower, stay. A wise beast feigns allegiance when the enemy's sword is at their throat, then leaves when the enemy's gaze is turned.~
@42250 = ~Thank you for telling me your story, my friend.~
@42251 = ~When challenged, you chose the coward's road. I am not surprised.~
@42252 = ~A wise man keeps his head and chooses to fight another day.~
@42253 = ~It would be more accurate to say I knelt before the witch, then fled Dragonspear at the earliest opportunity.~
@42254 = ~Thank you for telling me your story, my friend.~
@42255 = ~You ran like a whipped dog, is what you're saying.~
@42256 = ~You may be a coward, Odesseiron—but you're no fool.~
@42257 = ~What—? I mean—yes, of course I would see Rowena avenged. Do not question the honor of Odesseiron.~
@42258 = ~The Thayan people are masters of survival. Red Wizards doubly so. But what we do now runs counter to that primal instinct.~
@42259 = ~I have told it to you for a reason. We Thayans gauge our enemy, test their strength, retreating if need be, but always, always we are ready to strike.~
@42260 = ~Few know anger as I do, <CHARNAME>. Yet it makes fools of those who bend to it.~
@42261 = ~As Alveus Malcanter said, "The wise general does not lead from the front of the army." Think on it.~ [BD42261]
@42262 = ~Think on it. That is all I ask—for now.~
@42263 = ~Indeed. But you need not be the hammer that falls, only the one holding it—be mindful of not making the most valuable piece the most vulnerable, and while I am loathe to admit it, you are the strongest piece we have on this game board.~ [BD42263]
@42264 = ~It can wait. But not for long.~ [BD42264]
@42265 = ~Four Red Wizards? I can barely tolerate the one.~ [BD42265]
@42266 = ~Thou hast more patience for them than I.~
@42267 = ~I barely know the wizard, yet even I know better than to assume such a thing.~ [BD42267]
@42268 = ~I do not think vengeance drives the Red Wizard. Not when it comes at the expense of his own survival.~ [BD42268]
@42269 = ~I find it hard to imagine our friend running anywhere. A brisk walk or a light jog, perhaps.~ [BD42269]
@42270 = ~Thou invite this snake to join us, <CHARNAME>? Hast thou taken leave of thy senses?~ [BD42270]
@42271 = ~Quite the opposite. The wise seek to curry the favor of the powerful.~ [BD42271]
@42272 = ~The wise avoid the scorpion, and so it should be with thee.~ [BD42272]
@42273 = ~The wise had best mind their tongue, or it'll be torn from their filthy mouths! Who is this Rashemi scum? I'll not tolerate her presence!~
@42274 = ~And I'll not tolerate yours, Edwin. Calm yourself, but do it elsewhere—the camp if you must.~
@42275 = ~Edwin's staying with me. Anyone who has a problem with that can wait for me back at the camp.~
@42276 = ~You cast the noble Edwin Odesseiron aside for this... this WITCH? So be it. When your senses return, you shall find me in your camp, enjoying more civilized company.~ [BD42276]
@42277 = ~Why did you invite a Thayan jackal to our circle? They bite when one's back is turned and then yelp and flee to avoid a petting from my boot!~ [BD42277]
@42278 = ~It that is thy wish, it shall be respected. Fare thee well—and watch thy back.~ [BD42278]
@42279 = ~Thayans! Ptoo! Boo says those who lay with dogs get fleas.~ [BD42279]
@42280 = ~And what do those who lay with rodents get, I wonder?~ [BD42280]
@42281 = ~Wisdom! And some fleas.~ [BD42281]
@42282 = ~Hm. I suppose a rodent would have some wisdom to share with a Rashemi savage.~
@42283 = ~Silence, you two. We've enough to worry about without fighting amongst ourselves. Edwin, leave us.~
@42284 = ~Anyone who has a problem with Edwin can wait back at camp.~
@42285 = ~You cast the noble Edwin Odesseiron aside for this... this this? So be it. When your senses return, you shall find me in your camp, enjoying more civilized company.~ [BD42285]
@42286 = ~A frog can sooner trust a scorpion than a hero any son of Thay. But I shall do as you say, <CHARNAME>. Farewell.~ [BD42286]
@42287 = ~What is this? You cannot seriously ask a Thayan of my rank, a Red Wizard of the highest order, to work alongside Rashemi scum!~ [BD42287]
@42288 = ~Neither do I. Leave us, Edwin, and head to the camp.~
@42289 = ~Forgive me, Dynaheir. We need all the help we can get to face what lies ahead. ~
@42290 = ~Forgive me, Minsc... and Boo. We need all the help we can get to face what lies ahead.~
@42291 = ~Forgive me, Dynaheir, Minsc... and Boo. We need all the help we can get to face what lies ahead.~
@42292 = ~I am giving the orders. If you won't follow them, then leave and fend for yourself. ~
@42293 = ~You cast Edwin Odesseiron aside for this... this WITCH? So be it. When your senses return, you shall find me at the camp, enjoying more civilized company.~ [BD42293]
@42294 = ~I shall return to the camp... but I say (and Boo agrees) you are making a mistake. Farewell.~ [BD42294]
@42295 = ~I... shall respect thy wish. When thy senses return, seek me at the camp. Until then—watch thy back.~ [BD42295]
@42296 = ~Ready to head out? ~
@42297 = ~I am.~
@42298 = ~Soon.~
@42299 = ~Good. Let's go.~
@42300 = ~Make it sooner than that. We don't have time to waste.~
@42301 = ~The word on the road is that Caelar's followers have taken Boareskyr Bridge and surrounded Bridgefort. We'll not cross the Winding Water until they're dealt with.~ [BD42301]
@42302 = ~The watches have been set and scouts deployed, Corporal? The last thing we need is a band of trolls catching us unawares.~ [BD42302]
@42303 = ~Trolls we can handle. It's the crusade that worries me. We should make contact with those in Bridgefort—if there are any left.~ [BD42303]
@42304 = ~I'll scout to the north. Perhaps I can find a way to reach the fort's defenders.~
@42305 = ~I'd rather investigate the crusader camp and evaluate our enemy.~
@42306 = ~We should be pressing on instead of making camp.~
@42307 = ~Failing that, just kill as many crusaders as you can, but take care that you come back alive. We need you.~ [BD42307]
@42308 = ~Be prudent in your ranging. One of our scouts stumbled onto a troll cave to the northwest—she barely made it back alive.~ [BD42308]
@42309 = ~Getting eyes on the crusade can only help us. Don't engage the enemy if you can help it. And do NOT let them know who you are—unless you want a hundred zealots lining up to kill you.~ [BD42309]
@42310 = ~Whatever you do, be careful. The crusade seems satisfied to hold the bridge and keep the fort isolated for the moment, but that might not last. You don't want to be caught off-guard if they start moving again.~
@42311 = ~We rode day and night from the Coast Way to here. If we're going to face the crusade, we don't want to do it half-dead from lack of sleep.~ [BD42311]
@42312 = ~Baldur's Gate has enough martyrs. I'll not add to the number sending exhausted soldiers against the enemy.~ [BD42312]
@42313 = ~Prepare to be meeting your end, puppet of Caelar!~
