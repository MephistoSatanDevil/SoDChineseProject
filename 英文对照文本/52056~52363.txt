@52056 = ~You're going in the wrong direction, <CHARNAME>. ~
@52057 = ~Forgive me, Corwin.~
@52058 = ~You really don't want to talk to this man, do you?~
@52059 = ~You fear this man, Corwin? I thought you were made of sterner stuff than that.~
@52060 = ~Talk to him? No. That's about the last thing I want to do to him.~
@52061 = ~I'm flesh and bone, same as everyone else. And I'd rather keep my flesh on my bones, so let's go the other way, shall we?~
@52062 = ~Don't make me have to forgive you. Let's just get away from here.~
@52063 = ~All right. I don't think he saw me. ~
@52064 = ~Who is he, Corwin? Why are you afraid of him?~
@52065 = ~If he knows you, he might be willing to tell you something of the crusade's plans. This could be an opportunity.~
@52066 = ~Is that a story I smell? Tell me everything, dear lady. I'm all ears.~
@52067 = ~I mislike flight. Especially from a foe I could clearly best. Explain yourself.~
@52068 = ~I don't know who that was, nor do I care. Let's forget him and be about our business.~
@52069 = ~It's possible I could agree with you more, but at the moment I really can't think how. Let's go.~
@52070 = ~His name's Beno Famari. And it's not him I'm worried about, it's the hundreds of crusaders that'll come running if we cross paths. Because if that happens, there's a better than good chance I'll kill him again.~ [BD52070]
@52071 = ~I need to know exactly what's going on, Corwin.~
@52072 = ~Or you might be able to gather some intelligence about the crusade.~
@52073 = ~We'd better get out of here, then.~
@52074 = ~I can't imagine Beno willingly telling me anything useful. There's no love for me left in his coward heart.~ [BD52074]
@52075 = ~Left? So there was love once?~
@52076 = ~I need to know exactly what's going on here.~
@52077 = ~Best we avoid him, then.~
@52078 = ~Let's go.~
@52079 = ~That's one way of putting it. Come on, let's get out of here.~
@52080 = ~In a moment. First, I'd like to hear more about this Beno Famari.~
@52081 = ~You don't seriously expect me to drop this, do you? Tell me about this mystery man of yours.~
@52082 = ~As you wish.~
@52083 = ~Fine. Beno and I were... together. It was a long time ago and it didn't end well, especially for him. I got Rohma, so I'm not complaining.~ [BD52083]
@52084 = ~He fathered your daughter?~
@52085 = ~Beno doesn't strike me as a true believer in Caelar. A mercenary, more than likely. Could you speak to him, perhaps learn something of the crusade's defenses?~
@52086 = ~This Beno—I take it he hasn't been much involved in Rohma's life.~
@52087 = ~Yet you do not wish to speak to your daughter's father.~
@52088 = ~That explains your antipathy. All right, forget Beno. Let's do what we came here to do.~
@52089 = ~He was there when she was conceived. He was never her father. When I told him about Rohma...~ [BD52089]
@52090 = ~You raised a beautiful and intelligent child. I hate that this war takes you away from her.~
@52091 = ~If you can elicit even a little information about the crusade from Beno, our chances of survival will improve.~
@52092 = ~Yet you left your daughter to go battle an army of religious zealots hundreds of miles away.~
@52093 = ~The smart thing for us to do would be to leave this place.~
@52094 = ~Whatever I do in this life, whatever regrets I have, Rohma's not one of them. She never will be. I love her. Which is just one of the many reasons I'd rather avoid dying here.~ [BD52094]
@52095 = ~A sentiment I am sure we all share.~
@52096 = ~There are three things in my life that matter to me, <CHARNAME>. My daughter, my father, and the Flaming Fist. Each saved me, in their own way. When one of them calls on me, I answer. Always.~ [BD52096]
@52097 = ~This is no good, <CHARNAME>. Think about what you're saying. Bringing a little girl into battle with such an army would not be practical.~ [BD52097]
@52098 = ~You do yourself a disservice, living in bondage to an organization that cares nothing for you.~
@52099 = ~Says the half-orc that serves a demon. You're not really in a position to be throwing stones here, big boy.~ [BD52099]
@52100 = ~Keep talking, gnome. You'll miss it after I rip your tongue from your mouth.~
@52101 = ~If you really think I should talk to him, I will, but I'm telling you it's not a good idea.~ [BD52101]
@52102 = ~We have to try, Corwin.~
@52103 = ~He abandoned you and Rohma, did he not? It seems to me you're the injured party here.~
@52104 = ~How badly did things end? Other than the part where you killed him repeatedly, I mean.~
@52105 = ~Very well. Let us depart before he sees you.~
@52106 = ~He hurt me, I hurt him back. Let's just leave it at that. If you want to talk to him, let's go. Otherwise we should get back to our camp.~ [BD52106]
@52107 = ~If you insist. But whatever happens is on your head.~ [BD52107]
@52108 = ~<CHARNAME>! Captain Corwin clearly has no desire to speak to this man again. To even consider such a thing is beneath you.~
@52109 = ~Pretty badly, I'm guessing. On a scale of one to apocalyptic, I'd wager on something around "terrible."~ [BD52109]
@52110 = ~You assume men approach such things rationally. You really shouldn't.~
@52111 = ~Yes, and men are SO rational when it comes to such matters. You know better than that, <CHARNAME>. At least you should.~
@52112 = ~Helm's steely eye... Schael? Is that you?~ [BD52112]
@52113 = ~...Beno.~ [BD52113]
@52114 = ~I am <CHARNAME>. Pleased to meet you.~
@52115 = ~You know this man, Corwin? Why don't you introduce us?~
@52116 = ~This is no time to chat, Corwin. The Shining Lady's business must be done without delay.~
@52117 = ~Stand aside, mercenary. I'll not waste time on the likes of you.~
@52118 = ~Because we're leaving.~
@52119 = ~Come now. I know Audamar taught you better manners than that. Beno Famari. Glad to meet you—though I must admit I'm surprised to see Schael again here, of all places.~
@52120 = ~I have to go, Beno. We're on important business.~ [BD52120]
@52121 = ~I'm surprised, Schael. You were always so loyal to the Flaming Fist. What made you turn to Caelar?~ [BD52121]
@52122 = ~You heard <PRO_HIMHER>, Beno. We've got to go.~
@52123 = ~I'm not stopping you. I know better than to try. Farewell.~
@52124 = ~Just—hold for a moment. It's been a long time, Schael. I'm surprised to see you here.~
@52125 = ~It's a common enough tale, to be sure, but I have a hard time believing it. Schael Corwin turn against Baldur's Gate? I just can't see it.~ [BD52125]
@52126 = ~I'm Beno Famari. I'm surprised to see you, Schael.~ [BD52126]
@52127 = ~No more than I am to see you. You'll have to excuse us. We're on, uh, official crusade business.~ [BD52127]
@52128 = ~I'm sure. But what are you doing on this side of the wall? As a loyal member of the Flaming Fist, I'd think you'd be outside, laying siege to the castle.~
@52129 = ~We live in interesting times.~
@52130 = ~We have seen the Shining Lady's light. We are here to serve her will.~
@52131 = ~She's with me. I have come to see what Caelar Argent has to offer a <PRO_MANWOMAN> such as myself.~
@52132 = ~Caelar pays better than the Flaming Fist.~
@52133 = ~We've no time for this. Come, Corwin. We're leaving.~
@52134 = ~The Schael Corwin I know would never turn on the Flaming Fist. That was why things turned sour between us.~ [BD52134]
@52135 = ~That had nothing to do with what happened to us, Beno, and you know it. I'm not who I was when we were together. Motherhood opened my eyes. I want more from life than what the Fist promised. Is that so hard to believe?~ [BD52135]
@52136 = ~Just answer me one question, Schael. Just one question and I'll let you be on your way.~ [BD52136]
@52137 = ~How is... What is her name? Rohma, yes? How is my daughter?~ [BD52137]
@52138 = ~You've got no right to ask her that. Not after what you put her through.~
@52139 = ~As I understand it, you've never had anything to do with Rohma. Why do you care now?~
@52140 = ~Mind your step, Famari. You're heading into dangerous territory.~
@52141 = ~You ask her about Rohma? Are you mad, man? Or have you developed some sick taste for dying?~
@52142 = ~This conversation is over.~
@52143 = ~You may be telling it true, friend. But the Schael Corwin I knew would never turn on the Flaming Fist. She's a spy, and I'm gonna make a pile of gold turnin' her in.~ [BD52143]
@52144 = ~You and I are of one mind on that, my friend. But the Schael Corwin I knew? She would never turn on the Flaming Fist. Never. That was why things turned so sour between us.~
@52145 = ~They are at that. So how have you been, Schael?~
@52146 = ~Not that interesting. The Schael Corwin I knew would never turn on the Flaming Fist. That was why things turned so sour between us.~
@52147 = ~Schael didn't tell you? Well, I guess I was dead the last time she saw me. Come on, Schael. Tell me about OUR daughter.~
@52148 = ~She is well. Healthy and full of life. Cared for and well-loved. And now it is time for us to leave.~
@52149 = ~You gave up any right you had to be in Rohma's life a long time ago.~
@52150 = ~Rohma is well enough, though she's on the verge of losing a father.~
@52151 = ~Wouldn't be the first time, eh, Schael?~
@52152 = ~TAKE THEM!~
@52153 = ~I'm glad to hear the girl's well. Perhaps it will cushion the blow of losing her mother.~
@52154 = ~Good. That's good to know. Well, I'll not keep you any longer. We're beginning preparations for the final attack. This will all be over soon, one way or another.~ [BD52154]
@52155 = ~...Very well, I take your point. I'll not keep you. Goodbye, Schael.~ [BD52155]
@52156 = ~Beno, wait. Just this once, think of Rohma...~ [BD52156]
@52157 = ~I have a right to know about my child.~ [BD52157]
@52158 = ~Galad! That is low, Schael, even for you. My daughter's gone her whole life without a father. Let's see how she makes do without a mother...~ [BD52158]
@52159 = ~I suppose I did at that. Farewell, Schael. Truly.~
@52160 = ~What in the Nine Hells is going on here? ~
@52161 = ~You! Explain yourself! ~
@52162 = ~This man was a coward. He was without morals, knew nothing of honor. And so I slew him.~
@52163 = ~This mercenary was no true servant of Caelar.~
@52164 = ~There really isn't much to explain. This man was scum. I dealt with him accordingly.~
@52165 = ~I owe you no explanation.~
@52166 = ~Be that as it may, he was doing Caelar's work. Sometimes we must humble ourselves, and work with the unworthy to achieve our greater goals. ~
@52167 = ~You are right. I will try to keep it in mind in future.~
@52168 = ~So humility is the key to victory? You've given me much to think about. I will consider your words as I think on this.~
@52169 = ~I humble myself for no one, fool. Not for Caelar and certainly not for you.~
@52170 = ~I dislike them too, but Caelar has decreed we must tolerate their presence, for now, at least. Killing them puts her plans at risk. Would you have that go unpunished?~
@52171 = ~No, sir. I am at your mercy. Should you in your wisdom spare my life, know that this scenario will not repeat itself. I'll control my temper.~
@52172 = ~Yes...?~
@52173 = ~I don't see that you have much choice in the matter.~
@52174 = ~Clean up the bodies, then return to your duties. And in future, do not let yourself be ruled by impulse. Know that our goal is righteous and all, even mercenary scum, have a role to play. Now go.~
@52175 = ~Is there a cleric among you?~
@52176 = ~I am a cleric.~
@52177 = ~My friend here is a cleric.~
@52178 = ~No.~
@52179 = ~I'm afraid not.~
@52180 = ~And if there is, what of it?~
@52181 = ~I want these men healed and back in fighting shape immediately, you understand? When they're on their feet, bring them to me and we'll sort this matter out, whatever it was.~
@52182 = ~Someone fetch a cleric! I want these men resurrected. When that's done, bring them and the holy avenger here to me.~
@52183 = ~We should get out of here quickly, before Beno's resurrected. Let's go.~
@52184 = ~Oh, bind me, here we go...~ [BD52184]
@52185 = ~Such insolence. You are not fit to wear a Ring of the Crusade. Give it to me and begone from this place, or on my honor, I'll take it from your corpse.~
@52186 = ~Here, then. Take the ring.~
@52187 = ~No need to go that far. Take the ring. It was never a good fit anyway.~
@52188 = ~You want the ring? Come and take it.~
@52189 = ~You impudent... You disrespect me? ME? How dare you?~
@52190 = ~Those who wear this ring earned it in service to the Shining Lady. Out of respect for that, I will let you leave this place alive. Begone.~
@52191 = ~The Lady's blessing and a month's pay to whoever brings me that brazen cur's head!~
@52192 = ~So do you really want these fellows healed, <CHARNAME>? I'll do what I can for them if you want, but they didn't endear themselves to me when they attacked us. ~
@52193 = ~Do not tell me you seriously expect me to resurrect these men, <CHARNAME>. ~
@52194 = ~I won't tell you to do it, Viconia. But you will, nevertheless. It's the right thing to do.~
@52195 = ~Why not?~
@52196 = ~The only reason I'd restore them to life is so that I could have the pleasure of cutting them down again.~
@52197 = ~Even if we weren't in the middle of a camp full of our enemies, I could think of a few reasons. As it is, I can think of a few hundred.~
@52198 = ~An intriguing notion. But this isn't the place to indulge such fancies, I think.~
@52199 = ~The drow's right. Let's go.~
@52200 = ~They tried to kill us. Let death be their reward.~
@52201 = ~What? You? Stay away from me! Back, stay away! ~
@52202 = ~You there. I told you to resurrect those mercenaries you killed. Where are they? ~
@52203 = ~They were restored to life as ordered, sir. But the moment their lungs again drew breath, they fled.~
@52204 = ~I'm still working on getting them on their feet again, sir.~
@52205 = ~I left them where they fell. I answer to Caelar and Caelar alone.~
@52206 = ~Feeding the worms. You can join them, if you wish.~
@52207 = ~Bloody mercenaries...! You were right to slay them. Here, take this—it's what they would have been paid had they remained. Their lives aren't worth this much, but I regret forcing you to restore them now. Enough of that. Return to your duties.~
@52208 = ~You cost the crusade much-needed assets this day. But in restoring them you paid a cost yourself. In truth, we're better off without cowards in our ranks. It's time to put this behind us. Return to your duties.~
@52209 = ~Well, see that you do. Mercenaries or no, we'll need every sword we can get when the enemy makes their move.~
@52210 = ~I see. Forgive my impertinence, <PRO_SIRMAAM>. I'll leave you to your business.~
@52211 = ~Do you see Caelar here? Because I don't. And as long as I don't, you answer to me. Now find a way to restore those men or by the gods I'll see you join them!~
@52212 = ~You threaten me? Intolerable. Take <PRO_HIMHER>, and fetch me my whip. It's time this lunatic learned <PRO_HISHER> place in the holy crusade.~
@52213 = ~Yeah, what do you want? ~ [BD52213]
@52214 = ~Your name will do for a start.~
@52215 = ~I would know what the Shining Lady pays you for your service, mercenary.~
@52216 = ~I want to save your soul from eternal damnation. Have you heard the word of the great Lathander?~
@52217 = ~I want nothing from you.~
@52218 = ~It'll do for an end too. I'm Beno Famari. Now get thee gone. One more sermon singing the Shining Lady's praises and I swear I'll go to work for the Waterdhavians.~ [BD52218]
@52219 = ~I am no crusader.~
@52220 = ~You're not one of Caelar's zealots then. What do you make of the Shining Lady?~
@52221 = ~You would join those who lay siege to the castle?~
@52222 = ~You would betray Caelar?~
@52223 = ~I shall take my leave of you, then.~
@52224 = ~A mercenary, then. Better than a crusader, I suppose. What do you want? ~ [BD52224]
@52225 = ~Tell what the Shining Lady pays for your service.~
@52226 = ~What's your take on Caelar?~
@52227 = ~What I want you cannot provide. I'll take my leave of you.~
@52228 = ~More than she'd pay if I started discussing private business arrangements with strangers. Begone. You're making my knuckles itch.~ [BD52228]
@52229 = ~I haven't. I've heard the bones of people who preach at me break, though. Be on your way, godsbotherer.~ [BD52229]
@52230 = ~No, not really. I've had... issues... with certain Flaming Fists. I doubt they're among those surrounding the castle, but better safe than sorry. Now excuse me, we were discussing private matters.~ [BD52230]
@52231 = ~Then it's your lucky day. Fare thee well, <PRO_SIRMAAM>.~ [BD52231]
@52232 = ~She's mad as a mouther, but she pays well and on time. I've served worse. Now if you'll excuse us, we were discussing some private matters. Farewell.~ [BD52232]
@52233 = ~You do that.~
@52234 = ~Bloody godbotherer...~ [BD52234]
@52235 = ~Ach, my head, it pounds like waves against against a longship's hull. If I could perhaps sit down...?~
@52236 = ~That's enough out of you!~
@52237 = ~You there! Hero of Baldur's Gate. This man belong to you?~
@52238 = ~He's a friend, yes. What seems to be the trouble?~
@52239 = ~What's he done THIS time?~
@52240 = ~Certainly not.~
@52241 = ~Just a misunderstanding, ja? They say "stop," I hear "go." It is all very confusing.~
@52242 = ~Your friend here caused quite a ruckus last night. Drinking to excess, chasing the women officers, picking fights with the men. ~
@52243 = ~He mentioned your name when we arrested him. Otherwise he'd be in the stocks right now.~
@52244 = ~It was not so bad, <CHARNAME>. I may have had one drink too many, paid a slap for a kiss...~
@52245 = ~He grabbed Vigilant Halasan's, um, behind. She broke his nose.~
@52246 = ~And he emptied two casks of ale we were saving for a victory celebration. If this happens again, he'll wind up in the stocks no matter WHO he knows.~
@52247 = ~Hah! Voghiln's vastness can be contained by no stockade! Do your wurst—I mean worst! See what happens!~
@52248 = ~Voghiln, your drinking is getting to be a problem. I can't have you around if you're going to keep losing control.~
@52249 = ~I like a drink as much as the next ten people, but you've got to cut back. I'm serious.~
@52250 = ~You're embarrassing yourself, skald. And you're embarrassing me. I won't have you travel with me in this state.~
@52251 = ~No, my friend, do not be so harsh! I still can help you on your journey, ja? Sit with Voghiln. Drink with me. I will tell you why last night happened. ~
@52252 = ~You've had more than enough to drink.~
@52253 = ~Drinking MORE will help nothing, Voghiln. Don't you get it?~
@52254 = ~I can't think of a single good reason to do such a thing.~
@52255 = ~Scale of the dragon, ja? It soothes the head. There is a table in the northeast of camp. By a well. We drink there.~
@52256 = ~Very well. Join me and we'll find a place to sit.~
@52257 = ~If that's what it'll take to get you to listen, let's go find this table.~
@52258 = ~I'll see you there in a few minutes.~
@52259 = ~I don't care what you have to say. I certainly have no interest in drinking with you.~
@52260 = ~I will!~
@52261 = ~Then we go!~
@52262 = ~So it is, then. So it will be.~
@52263 = ~By the Oakfather's parched throat, is there no ale in this wasteland? Wait, this cup has something in the bottom... Wine? Only one way to find out!~
@52264 = ~You wake up hungover and arrested and go right back to your cups. This is a problem.~
@52265 = ~Voghiln, stop. That's not sanitary.~
@52266 = ~You wanted to talk. Talk.~
@52267 = ~Ach, where is mine head? Here, my friend. I share my drink with you. Once you quaff with me, then we will talk.~
@52268 = ~I'm... honored, I supposed. Give me the cup.~
@52269 = ~I've heard there are nine Hells. There's no way in any of them I'm drinking what's in that cup.~
@52270 = ~If it will get you to talk faster, I'll drink.~
@52271 = ~This refusal, it harpoons my heart! This is a sign of great respect! How can I speak truthfully to someone who will not even share a drink with me?~
@52272 = ~Give me the cup.~
@52273 = ~Keep silent, then. I won't drink.~
@52274 = ~Our bond is severed before it is forged.~
@52275 = ~Now our bond is sealed. I drink to honor many such bonds. Nine such drinks I must down each night.~
@52276 = ~You drink NINE cups of ale every night? That's a lot.~
@52277 = ~Did you get a wizard to enchant your liver?~
@52278 = ~I'm sure there's a tedious tale behind your ritual.~
@52279 = ~Our bond is sealed. I drink to honor many such bonds. Nine drinks I must down each night, in memory of those passed on before me. It is a difficult ritual to uphold, but I do it gladly, in their names.~
@52280 = ~You've fought many battles, Voghiln. Why do these nine need remembering?~
@52281 = ~You enjoy this ritual a little too much, I fear. Who are the nine you drink to?~
@52282 = ~And what are their names?~
@52283 = ~It's enough that you know the reason for my excesses. I drink to honor their memories, ja?~
@52284 = ~You said we had a "bond" since I drank that disgusting liquid you offered me. Tell me of these people you honor, that I might also drink to their memory.~
@52285 = ~You're avoiding the subject. Why won't you tell me their names?~
@52286 = ~You didn't answer my question.~
@52287 = ~I know when someone trying to pull the wool over someone else's eyes when I see it, skald. And I'm looking at it right now.~
@52288 = ~I... I cannot tell you their names. I have forgotten. For over a year we traveled together. Then in one great battle, I lost nine brave companions. We all fought valiantly, but they died while I lived.~
@52289 = ~For over a year, we traveled together. Then in one great battle, I lost nine brave companions. We all fought valiantly, but they died while I lived.~
@52290 = ~It is n-never easy to lose a friend in b-battle.~
@52291 = ~I swore that every night I would drink to the memory of their lives. And the cool ale... it washed away the fire of my pain.~
@52292 = ~Tell me more.~
@52293 = ~But you forgot their names?~
@52294 = ~Get to the point.~
@52295 = ~I traveled down the Sword Coast, finding solace in ale and beautiful women. In time I began to forget. I welcomed the forgetting, because my pain went with it.~
@52296 = ~I traveled the Sword Coast, finding solace in ale and the beautiful women. In time, I began to forget. I welcomed the forgetting—my pain went with it. Now all I have of my friends are memories shrouded in mist, like a Moonsea fog at dawn...~
@52297 = ~Drinking does your friends no honor now, Voghiln.~
@52298 = ~Getting falling-down drunk and winding up in the stocks is how you honor your friends' memory? That's madness.~
@52299 = ~No more excuses, Voghiln. You drink for yourself, not for those who fell beside you.~
@52300 = ~I know! By all the gods above, I know. But this is all I have—what else can I do?~
@52301 = ~What if you constructed some sort of memorial?~
@52302 = ~You're a skald. Write an epic poem; immortalize them.~
@52303 = ~It matters not to me, but if you're to be of any use to anyone, you'd best gain control of yourself.~
@52304 = ~I have it! I shall find nine items, one to honor each of my lost comrades! And you shall help me, ja? Anything curious or beautiful could help me remember.~
@52305 = ~I'll watch for anything that might work as a token.~
@52306 = ~A scavenger hunt it is! I'll keep a sharp eye out.~
@52307 = ~If I must, but I'll not go out of my way. I'm here to end Caelar's life, not celebrate your friends.~
@52308 = ~This is an admirable idea way to commemorate your lost friends, Voghiln. I approve.~
@52309 = ~And now a drink to toast the grand plan! Uh, a drink of water I mean, ja?~
@52310 = ~<CHARNAME>? A moment of your time? ~
@52311 = ~For you, of course.~
@52312 = ~A moment, a smidgen, a wee bit... whatever you need.~
@52313 = ~What is it?~
@52314 = ~I heard about your talk with Voghiln. I think it's a good idea to keep him focused away from the drink. I've seen soldiers go downhill fast when they can't stop drinking.~
@52315 = ~I heard about your talk with Voghiln, <CHARNAME>. Getting him to think about something other than wine and ale is a good idea. I've lost too many people to drink in my time. Anyway, I thought he might like to have these. What do you think?~
@52316 = ~What are they?~
@52317 = ~Are those earrings?~
@52318 = ~You'd give him your own jewelry? That's very kind.~
@52319 = ~These are pure silver earrings, given me by my friend Neoma. I don't wear them when I'm in uniform, but I carry them with me. Neoma's still alive, though. Voghiln's friends aren't. I don't think Neoma would mind me losing them if they were to help someone.~
@52320 = ~I'm certain Voghiln will appreciate the thought.~
@52321 = ~I'd try to talk you out of giving up such a sentimental item, but I can see it would do no good.~
@52322 = ~They are yours to give away.~
@52323 = ~Give them to him, then, with my good wishes.~
@52324 = ~The lady Corwin is as generous as she is beautiful. The earrings, they shine like silver stars. They remind me of someone... I can almost... Audria and, and... Ulvana! Ja! I remember!~
@52325 = ~Ja, I remember! Their names were Audria and... and... Ulvana! Ja, Audria and Ulvana! Sisters they were.~
@52326 = ~Sisters they were. Both carried swords with silver hilts. The Silver Sisters, I called them. These earrings will serve to remind me of them. Never again shall I forget their names. Thank you again, dear lady.~
@52327 = ~You're welcome, skald.~
@52328 = ~Ja, ja, <CHARNAME>. What is it old Voghiln can do for you?~
@52329 = ~Corwin gave me these silver earrings. She thought you might use them as tokens to remember and honor your fallen friends.~
@52330 = ~This piece of petrified wood is unusual. Would it be a suitable token to your friends' memory?~
@52331 = ~I found this carving... it looks like it's made from fish bones.~
@52332 = ~These three pebbles are identical. Isn't that strange?~
@52333 = ~Look at this beautiful glass ornament I found.~
@52334 = ~Take a look at this book of poetry. I thought you might appreciate it.~
@52335 = ~Within the captain's cold shell there is a warm heart. Who knew? These earrings, they shine like silver stars. They remind me of someone... I can almost... Audria and, and... Ulvana! Ja! I remember!~
@52336 = ~Ja, I remember! Their names were Audria and... and... Ulvana! Ja, Audria and Ulvana! Sisters they were.~
@52337 = ~Sisters they were. Both carried swords with silver hilts. The Silver Sisters, I called them. These earrings will serve to remind me of them. Never again shall I forget their names.~
@52338 = ~Let me see it... Ja, it seems very old. Look how smooth the wood has worn. And heavy as stone! It makes me think of someone—an elf who traveled with me.~
@52339 = ~There was an elf who traveled with me. I can remember her voice as she talked about the forests of her home. And her face, I remember her face.~
@52340 = ~I remember her voice as she talked about the forests of her home. I remember her face... Ondiasi was her name. A fine archer and better swordswoman. I'll keep this bit of tree to remember her by.~
@52341 = ~Nay, 'tis carved from walrus tusk—scrimshaw, they call it back home. A man from the north once fought at my side. We met him in Vaasa, and he joined our troop. He carved bits of bone into wondrous things—carved a bone drinking horn for himself!~
@52342 = ~We met him in Vaasa and he joined our troop. He called himself Wicuf and carried a bone drinking horn he crafted himself!~
@52343 = ~Wicuf, he called himself. Wicuf, I remember you now! I shall not forget you again with this scrimshaw in my pack!~
@52344 = ~Ja, most curious. All the same size, the same shape and sheen. Something about them recalls a memory... Three brothers traveled with me once. Born years apart, but they were alike as these pebbles.~
@52345 = ~There were brothers who traveled with me, three brothers. Born years apart, but they were alike as these pebbles.~
@52346 = ~Conal was the eldest, and Donal the middle. The youngest was... By my beard, let me think! Ah! Taig, that was he. These pebbles will serve as tokens to remind me of them always.~
@52347 = ~A fragile bauble, but see how it catches the light. It makes me think of the morning sun on the Great Glacier's icefields. Strange what memories are roused by such small trinkets...~
@52348 = ~Strange what memories arise from such small trinkets. The glimmering glass reminds me of a woman. Slender and sharp as an icicle, but with such a warmth about her.~
@52349 = ~The glimmering glass reminds me of a woman. Slender and sharp as an icicle, but with such a warmth about her. Beautiful, ja, and deadly with her magic! Zerihyda. Ah, Zerihyda, I shall not forget you again.~
@52350 = ~Bah! Southern poetry is so weak tea indeed! In the north, we sing rousing ballads fire and love to our women! Eh, perhaps this is not so bad. There is passion here. The writing has heart.~
@52351 = ~This is good stuff, though. Full of heart. It reminds me of a bard who traveled with me. He said one day he would immortalize us in song.~
@52352 = ~A bard once traveled at my side. He said he would immortalize our party in song. Poor lad, he died too young. No one shall remember his name. No one but Voghiln, from this day forth. And I write it on the flyleaf... "Evald."~
@52353 = ~The task is done, mine friend. I have the tokens here, one for each of my fallen companions.~
@52354 = ~I'm certain your comrades would be honored to be remembered this way.~
@52355 = ~Congratulations. Maybe now the rest of us will be able to get a sip of ale now and then.~
@52356 = ~Perhaps now we can turn our attention to our actual mission.~
@52357 = ~I could not have done this without you, <CHARNAME>. Before, I was a slave to my pain and the drink. Now when I raise a cup, it will be in gladness!~
@52358 = ~And I will raise a cup to toast your companions along with you!~
@52359 = ~Just don't raise TOO many cups. ~
@52360 = ~So long as you can keep up with me and fight when needed, do whatever you like.~
@52361 = ~I thank you the best way I know how—in an epic poem celebrating your great deeds. Ja, I start right away! But in case my words do not find favor with you, take this as well, with mine deepest thanks.~
@52362 = ~But in case an epic poem is not quite the reward for which you hoped, take this as well. With my deep and enduring thanks.~
@52363 = ~Here I am in the Nine Hells and still I have not found a token to remember my lost companions by. Perhaps I write an ode to memorialize this sorry state, ja?~
