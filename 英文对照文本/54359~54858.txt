@54359 = ~Is there something I can do for you, <CHARNAME>? ~ [BD54359]
@54360 = ~Why do you ask?~
@54361 = ~I'm trying to think of a way to answer that doesn't end with me getting slapped. And failing miserably. Well, perhaps not miserably—some things are worth a slap.~
@54362 = ~You've done more than enough for me already, and I thank you for it.~
@54363 = ~Nothing I can't do better for myself.~
@54364 = ~Look around you, <CHARNAME>. Are you in a tavern? A whorehouse? No? Then grow up. We have work to do—YOU have work to do. Stop playing the fool and do it.~ [BD54364]
@54365 = ~I simply thought that if we're to travel together, face Caelar Argent together, we might do well to get to know one another.~ [BD54365]
@54366 = ~I would like nothing better, Captain. But I fear you'll not find me good company at the moment.~
@54367 = ~I suspect you'll know all of me you want to and more before our business with the Shining Lady is at an end.~
@54368 = ~Agreed. Let's go find some place private and get to... knowing each other.~
@54369 = ~I mean no offense, but I think I'd prefer this relationship remain professional.~
@54370 = ~You barely know me. ~
@54371 = ~I'd like to change that.~
@54372 = ~I know enough to know I'd like to know more.~
@54373 = ~I'm an excellent judge of character.~
@54374 = ~Certainly not in the way I'd like to know you.~
@54375 = ~If you truly believe that, then let it remain so.~
@54376 = ~Fair enough. Let's go.~
@54377 = ~Agreed. Let's go.~
@54378 = ~Let's concentrate on the mission, then. If we can do what the Grand Dukes have asked, I'll be satisfied.~ [BD54378]
@54379 = ~If that is all you want of me, then it shall be done. And if you should ever want something more... you will let me know, yes?~
@54380 = ~Would that everyone were so easy to satisfy.~
@54381 = ~Is that really all you want? I think there's more to you than duty. Tell me, what is it you're feeling. What do you desire?~
@54382 = ~Your and the Council's satisfaction means little to me. I've my own reasons to seek Caelar Argent and put a stop to her.~
@54383 = ~You think it'll be easy? I admire your optimism, if nothing else. Let's go.~ [BD54383]
@54384 = ~This isn't the time. I have a mission. That's all that matters. So let's go.~ [BD54384]
@54385 = ~Can I have a word, <CHARNAME>? ~
@54386 = ~Of course, Corwin. It's always a pleasure to speak with you.~
@54387 = ~That depends on the word you want to have. If "idiot" is one of them, find another to talk to.~
@54388 = ~You can have three, Corwin: Leave me alone.~
@54389 = ~I've little desire to discuss anything with you beyond Caelar and her mad crusade.~
@54390 = ~Would that it were so. I owe you an apology. ~
@54391 = ~You owe me nothing, Corwin.~
@54392 = ~I couldn't agree more.~
@54393 = ~Let that debt go unpaid. I don't want to hear it.~
@54394 = ~I suppose I deserve that. Very well. If this is how it's to be between us, then this is how it shall be.~
@54395 = ~I've been thinking about what will happen when we reach Dragonspear. I've never served in a coalition before. Alliances bring strength, so long as everyone can get along.~ [BD54395]
@54396 = ~Three armies working together... it won't be easy on the soldiers. Or anyone.~
@54397 = ~It's a good thing you have me as an ally, then. That's at least one person you can count on to be on your side.~
@54398 = ~I don't want you to be sorry. I want you to be happy. Lighten up, for gods' sake.~
@54399 = ~I don't have time to anticipate future problems. I have enough present ones. Let's concentrate on the mission instead of small talk.~
@54400 = ~Not through your eye. Maybe a leg.~
@54401 = ~This life isn't easy for anyone, I know. It was easier, once, when all I had to worry about was myself. A child changes things. I have responsibilities. To Rohma, to my father... to the Fist, of course. ~ [BD54401]
@54402 = ~I've let other people into my life since Rohma was born. They... I don't want to talk about them. My father says you only need one to win the game, but I'm tired of playing games.~ [BD54402]
@54403 = ~Let's not play them, then. I am attracted to you, Corw—Schael. What comes of that is up to you. If nothing comes of it at all, I've no regrets having said what I've said.~
@54404 = ~Life is a game.~
@54405 = ~You need to find the right person to play with. Take me, for instance.~
@54406 = ~Then let us end this one before it begins. I'm not interested in you, Corwin. Not like that. Let's keep our relationship professional.~
@54407 = ~Aye. That would be for the best, I think.~ [BD54407]
@54408 = ~I appreciate your being so... forthright. I won't deny I'm drawn to you. But after what happened in my last relationship, with Tianna... Give me some time to consider this. Please.~ [BD54408]
@54409 = ~For you, perhaps. Some of us can't afford to take everything so lightly. Too much depends on us. Ah, well, I'm rambling now. Let's keep moving.~ [BD54409]
@54410 = ~I don't want to talk about this anymore. Let's go.~
@54411 = ~It's all a big joke for you, isn't it? I wish I could be so carefree.~
@54412 = ~There are worse things to be than happy.~
@54413 = ~Then be it. There's nothing easier.~
@54414 = ~You could be, if you truly desired it. But you won't, will you? You're happier to play the suffering mother, bemoaning her fate to a cruel world.~
@54415 = ~I was happy once. ~
@54416 = ~Some would say you're lucky to have had that. I am not one of them. I know little of you, Schael, but I am quite certain you deserve a happily ever after.~
@54417 = ~You can be again. I'll show you. You'll see.~
@54418 = ~You cling to misery like moss to a tree. Pathetic.~
@54419 = ~I envy you your optimism, <CHARNAME>. But I can make no promises. Let's go. ~
@54420 = ~Do you have any children, <CHARNAME>? ~ [BD54420]
@54421 = ~No. Not yet, anyway. Someday, I hope. If I'm lucky.~
@54422 = ~Not that I'm aware of, and I'm fairly sure I'd have noticed.~
@54423 = ~I hope not.~
@54424 = ~Only a fool would bring a child into a world like this one.~
@54425 = ~Some would see children as a gift. ~
@54426 = ~Indeed. A gift I hope the gods see fit to bestow upon me one day.~
@54427 = ~If children are such a gift, why do you spend time away from Rohma?~
@54428 = ~And some have children like Skie Silvershield.~
@54429 = ~Fools, all of them.~
@54430 = ~I am a fool, then? ~ [BD54430]
@54431 = ~Of course not. Forgive me, Corwin. I spoke without thinking.~
@54432 = ~Foolish, or selfish. I can see no other reason to burden a child with life.~
@54433 = ~Only you can know that with any certainty.~
@54434 = ~You don't really want me to answer that question.~
@54435 = ~Some would see life as a gift. ~
@54436 = ~Generally speaking, they're right to do so. But how great that gift is lies on the shoulders of the parents. Or parent, as the case may be.~
@54437 = ~I imagine thinking so would alleviate the guilt, somewhat.~
@54438 = ~A gift? For Skie Silvershield and those who share her advantages, perhaps. For most it is a squalid , pointless existence.~
@54439 = ~Fools, all of them.~
@54440 = ~I'd hate to see Rohma grow up to be anything like Skie Silvershield. ~
@54441 = ~With you as her mother? I can't see that happening.~
@54442 = ~There are worse things for a child to be than spoiled.~
@54443 = ~Between her living in Baldur's Gate and your duties as an officer of the Flaming Fist, you'll be lucky to see her grow up at all.~
@54444 = ~Unfortunately, children don't remain children. Not if they're lucky.~
@54445 = ~You are in a foul temper this day. I'll leave you to it.~ [BD54445]
@54446 = ~You'd be willing to give up adventure? To turn your back on this life you lead?~
@54447 = ~The life of endless violence, chaos, and bloodshed? I think I could make the sacrifice.~
@54448 = ~You think I'd have to? You have Rohma, yet here you are.~
@54449 = ~I'd be happy enough to turn away from it. Unfortunately, it seems wholly unwilling to do me the same courtesy.~
@54450 = ~It's not adventure I seek. It's wealth. Power. Comfort. When I have secured those things, then I shall rest. And then, perhaps, I shall consider having children. But not before.~
@54451 = ~Thanks for that, <CHARNAME>. I wasn't feeling near guilty enough already this <DAYNIGHTALL>. ~
@54452 = ~You have nothing to feel guilty about, Schael. You are doing what you must to provide for your family.~
@54453 = ~I've seen little of Rohma, Corwin, but what I have seen tells me that when it comes to your daughter, you've little to feel guilty for.~
@54454 = ~Guilty? Why? It's not as though you've unleashed another Skie Silvershield upon the world.~
@54455 = ~You feel only what you allow yourself to feel. Don't blame me for your shortcomings.~
@54456 = ~There's nothing I wouldn't do for Rohma and my father. But the time my duties take me away from them, the risks the job carries with it... Sometimes I wonder if I've made the right decision. Is a full belly worth an absent mother?~ [BD54456]
@54457 = ~A loving mother is a prize beyond measure. I speak from hard experience.~
@54458 = ~You're asking the wrong <PRO_MANWOMAN>. I never knew my mother.~
@54459 = ~A full belly is worth anything to a starving <PRO_MANWOMAN>. You do what you must for your child, Corwin. Don't ever doubt that.~
@54460 = ~You speak to one who had no mother, who knows hunger all too well. Do you truly need to ask that question?~
@54461 = ~I'm sorry. I didn't mean to bring up a painful subject. It's just hard, with me away so often and Rohma's father not around. Sometimes I think she might have been better off if I'd left her on the steps of the Temple of the Radiant Heart, like her father wanted.~ [BD54461]
@54462 = ~Reprehensible. Rohma's father had better hope he and I never cross paths.~
@54463 = ~She's lucky to have you as a mother. No one could replace you in her life.~
@54464 = ~Too late to find out now.~
@54465 = ~Better she die than be raised by zealots. The last thing this world needs is another Caelar.~
@54466 = ~He was. We both were. ~
@54467 = ~How did we get talking about this? Let's talk about something else—better still, let's just not talk at all for a while, all right?~ [BD54467]
@54468 = ~Speaking without thought is the surest way to speak the truth.~ [BD54468]
@54469 = ~Considering the way he and I ended things, I'd say that's highly unlikely.~ [BD54469]
@54470 = ~I'm going to take that as a joke. It'll be healthier for both of us. But don't make a joke like that ever again.~
@54471 = ~We need to talk, <CHARNAME>. ~ [BD54471]
@54472 = ~Whatever you need, Schael. You know that.~
@54473 = ~What's on your mind?~
@54474 = ~Outside of our mission, I believe I'm done talking with you, Captain.~
@54475 = ~No, we don't. We need to focus on what we're doing here. Nothing else matters, certainly not conversation. I'm sure you understand.~
@54476 = ~I see. Perhaps that's for the best. Yes. Let's leave it there, then.~ [BD54476]
@54477 = ~Stop calling me that. Corwin or captain—for now, at least. Please.~
@54478 = ~I'm not happy with the way we—with the way I left things when we were talking about children. Rohma. Damn it, why is this so hard?~ [BD54478]
@54479 = ~The important things are never easy.~
@54480 = ~Said the courtesan to the cleric.~
@54481 = ~Wow. Someone really messed you up, didn't they?~
@54482 = ~It's not something we need to discuss now. Or ever. I think it would be best if we stay friends, and nothing more.~
@54483 = ~Can you try to be serious just for one gods damned minute?~ [BD54483]
@54484 = ~Aye, you're right about that. All right, here it is...~ [BD54484]
@54485 = ~I don't think it's any great secret that I've found myself attracted to you these past few weeks. I'm attracted to a lot of people. Attraction is easy enough to deal with. Feelings are another story.~ [BD54485]
@54486 = ~Some stories have happy endings.~
@54487 = ~Some stories have happy endings.~
@54488 = ~Feelings can be easy too. If it feels good, do it. If it doesn't, stop.~
@54489 = ~Your feelings are your own problem. Deal with them on your own time, and stop wasting mine.~
@54490 = ~The life we lead pushes us to places we may not want to go—not yet. I've made mistakes before—too many mistakes. I'm trying to make better choices, not just for me, but for Rohma.~ [BD54490]
@54491 = ~The last person I shared my bed with... It didn't turn out well with her. Not as bad as with Rohma's father, but not well.~ [BD54491]
@54492 = ~If I'm to do this again, I need it to work. I need to think, not just feel. I can't rush into another doomed relationship. And it felt like that's what I was about to do.~ [BD54492]
@54493 = ~That's why I shut you out when we started talking about children. Because I can't afford to let you in—let anybody in. Not until I know they're the right one.~ [BD54493]
@54494 = ~I understand completely. Take your time. When you decide what you want, I'll be here. You're worth waiting for.~
@54495 = ~I'd like you to be more than a friend, Corwin—but if that's all I'm ever able to call you, I'll count myself blessed. Let's see where this relationship goes together.~
@54496 = ~If you've not decided yet, you never will. Let me make this easy for you. We shall do as the Council wishes and end the threat of Caelar. When that task is finished, so are we.~
@54497 = ~Thank you, <CHARNAME>. Thank you for understanding.~ [BD54497]
@54498 = ~Friends it is, then. Thank you, <CHARNAME>. Thank you for understanding. Let's go.~ [BD54498]
@54499 = ~I've been watching you, <CHARNAME>. And of late, I don't like what I see. If we're to be friends and nothing more, so be it. Colleagues and nothing else? Fine. ~ [BD54499]
@54500 = ~But you've got to decide what exactly we will be—if anything—and soon, or I'll make the decision for you.~ [BD54500]
@54501 = ~I want more than friendship, Schael. I want you.~
@54502 = ~I'm sorry, but Rasaad and I have grown close. I hope you and I can remain friends.~
@54503 = ~I must admit, I do have feelings for Rasaad—but they're nothing compared to what I feel for you.~
@54504 = ~You would have me choose 'twixt you and Viconia?~
@54505 = ~I must admit, I do have feelings for Viconia—but they're nothing compared to what I feel for you.~
@54506 = ~Don't make me choose between you and Glint. He means much to me.~
@54507 = ~I must admit, I do have feelings for Glint—but they're nothing compared to what I feel for you.~
@54508 = ~You would have me choose between you and Safana? How am I supposed to do that?~
@54509 = ~I must admit, I do have feelings for Safana—but they're nothing compared to what I feel for you.~
@54510 = ~Dorn and I are destined to be together. Our futures are entwined like two serpents, each eating the others' tail.~
@54511 = ~I must admit, I do have feelings for Dorn—but they're nothing compared to what I feel for you.~
@54512 = ~I have treasured our time together, Schael. I truly have. But I would be lying to myself if I told you my feelings for Neera weren't greater than any others I have. Worse, I'd be lying to you.~
@54513 = ~I must admit, I do have feelings for Neera—but they're nothing compared to what I feel for you.~
@54514 = ~I feel like an idiot saying this, but then, only an idiot would: Voghiln is the one my heart desires.~
@54515 = ~I must admit, I do have feelings for Voghiln-but they're nothing compared to what I feel for you.~
@54516 = ~We will be comrades in arms, but nothing more.~
@54517 = ~I never meant to push you away. But if this is what you want, far be it from me to try and stop you. ~
@54518 = ~You give up too easily, Corwin. I see now we could never have worked together as anything but professional colleagues.~
@54519 = ~Huh. I'd hoped you'd put up a bit more of a fight than that.~
@54520 = ~So meek, so submissive. How you rose to the rank of captain, I'll never know.~
@54521 = ~I don't like games, <CHARNAME>. If you do, find someone else to play them with. I've more important matters to attend to.~
@54522 = ~There's lots of things about me you'll never know, <CHARNAME>.~
@54523 = ~So long as we're still that, I'll be fine. We've a job to do. Let's go get it done.~ [BD54523]
@54524 = ~That you can't choose tells me all I need to know. Go, follow your heart. I hope you find happiness.~ [BD54524]
@54525 = ~That's all I needed to hear. Let's go.~ [BD54525]
@54526 = ~That you can't choose tells me all I need to know. Go, be with your drow. I hope you find happiness together.~ [BD54526]
@54527 = ~Baravar's cloak, <CHARNAME>! You know I pride myself on being an open-minded fellow, but there are limits.~
@54528 = ~I know some who've made this sort of thing work, but I've never been one of them. One lover at a time is enough for me. Usually it's too much.~
@54529 = ~Tell me about it.~
@54530 = ~Best for everyone that we keep our relationship strictly professional. Go, be with the gnome. I hope he makes you happy. Truly.~
@54531 = ~Let me do it for you, darling. I like my men a bit more... firm. I'm disappointed in you, but not surprised.~
@54532 = ~Wrong answer, <CHARNAME>. You're welcome to try and make something with the thief. For myself, I'll return my focus to where it should've been to begin with—on ending the crusade and getting home to my daughter.~
@54533 = ~To think I even considered the possibility of you and I being together. Madness. Be with Dorn, then. I want nothing more to do with you.~ [BD54533]
@54534 = ~Better a harsh certainty than a soft doubt. Go, be with the elf.~
@54535 = ~Half-elf.~
@54536 = ~I hope you find happiness together. Truly. For myself, I'll return my focus to where it should've been to begin with—on ending the crusade and getting home to my daughter.~
@54537 = ~Not the answer I wanted, but better to know a harsh truth than live in ignorance. For me, anyway.~
@54538 = ~We're getting close, <CHARNAME>. This will all be over soon. ~ [BD54538]
@54539 = ~Then I'll be back to Baldur's Gate and you'll be back to Rohma.~
@54540 = ~One way or another.~
@54541 = ~Don't get careless. We've come a long way, but there's still a long way to go.~
@54542 = ~It'll be over TOO soon if you don't focus.~
@54543 = ~Don't be morbid. We've come too far, endured too much to be thwarted now. ~
@54544 = ~Of all the gifts you've given me, none is more precious than hope. I wouldn't have made it this far without you.~
@54545 = ~I hope you're right, Schael.~
@54546 = ~We can ALWAYS be thwarted. That's why we have to hold on to every moment. You never know when it will all end.~
@54547 = ~Caelar doesn't care what we've been through. Focus, woman! I'll not die, for you or anyone.~
@54548 = ~Come here. ~ [BD54548]
@54549 = ~What? Why?~
@54550 = ~You aren't going to slap me, are you?~
@54551 = ~Much as I'd like to, I can't. We have to focus. I can't be distracted.~
@54552 = ~I want to kiss you. ~ [BD54552]
@54553 = ~That's the best thing I've heard in a long time.~
@54554 = ~And I want to let you.~
@54555 = ~I can't, not right now. Too much requires our attention.~
@54556 = ~There's better things your lips could be doing than talking right now, <CHARNAME>. Shut up and come here.~
@54557 = ~All right. Let's go.~
@54558 = ~Gods, I hope you're right.~
@54559 = ~We've come too far to be stopped now.~
@54560 = ~There's a first time for everything.~
@54561 = ~There's only one way to find out.~
@54562 = ~You should know better than to doubt me by now.~
@54563 = ~Not quite far enough, for my taste.~
@54564 = ~We have come a long way. But not quite far enough.~
@54565 = ~I'm plenty focused right now.~
@54566 = ~All right. Let's see this thing done.~
@54567 = ~I'll take your words over roses any day, <CHARNAME>.~ [BD54567]
@54568 = ~What? Why would you even think that?~
@54569 = ~And you should know better than to take that tone with me. Come on. Let's see an end to this.~
@54570 = ~I'm almost there, Rohma. I'll be home soon... ~ [BD54570]
@54571 = ~I don't think I've ever seen you smile like that before, Schael. You should do it more often.~
@54572 = ~Not nearly soon enough. But at least we're alive to make the trip. That's no small thing, considering.~
@54573 = ~Rohma? We survived one of the Nine Hells and that's all you can think of?~
@54574 = ~Come back to Baldur's Gate with me, <CHARNAME>. I'll smile a lot more once I see my daughter again.~ [BD54574]
@54575 = ~And will Rohma smile to see me, do you think?~
@54576 = ~That sounds like an invitation.~
@54577 = ~Perhaps I can coax a smile or two out of you before then.~
@54578 = ~You think about that girl too much, Corwin. It's time you did something for yourself. Past time, in fact.~
@54579 = ~There's a reason for that. Come here. Let me give you a taste of what it's an invitation to.~ [BD54579]
@54580 = ~You stink of sulfur, you know that?~
@54581 = ~I did just escape one of the Nine Hells.~
@54582 = ~I'm pretty sure that's you.~
@54583 = ~That's just my clothes. I can get rid of them easily enough.~
@54584 = ~A kiss or two and already you're trying to change me to suit your whims. No, I'll not accept it. Whatever was between us? It's done.~
@54585 = ~So what do you say? Will you come back to Baldur's Gate? With me, I mean?~
@54586 = ~Try and stop me.~
@54587 = ~What about Rohma?~
@54588 = ~You have a daughter, Corwin. And I'm... I'm not parent material. Look at my father if you don't believe me. We can't be together. For Rohma's sake.~
@54589 = ~I've indulged you for too long. No more. I'll not burden myself with your petty needs and desires.~
@54590 = ~I don't think I will. Let's go find somewhere private.~
@54591 = ~If I have to choose between you and her, you must know who I'll go with. But she wants me to be happy and she's a sharp kid. I think she'll approve.~ [BD54591]
@54592 = ~Back to the city, then, as soon as we can. In the meantime, let's go find someplace a little more private...~ [BD54592]
@54593 = ~I'll take it. Now come here a second. There's something else I want to take.~
@54594 = ~If you knew me at all, you'd know Rohma's all I ever think of and all I ever care to think of. I thought you understood that. I guess I was wrong. Better to find out now than learn it later, I suppose. Enjoy your victory—you earned it. But you'll celebrate it without me.~ [BD54594]
@54595 = ~Let's find out.~
@54596 = ~Seriously?~
@54597 = ~No. We cannot be together, but that's not why. It's Rohma. She's lost her father and come far too close to losing her mother. I don't know what the future brings. But I couldn't bear to cause her—or you—sorrow. This is where we must part ways.~
@54598 = ~Listen, Corwin. I'm—I'm not parent material. Just look at my father if you don't believe me. Well, don't look at him; he's dead and kind of hideous. But you see what I'm getting at. You and I can't be together. For Rohma's sake.~
@54599 = ~Seriously? No. But I had you going, didn't I?~
@54600 = ~I am <PRO_MASTERMISTRESS> of my own fate. No one controls me—not even you.~
@54601 = ~Gods damn it... Gods DAMN it! You're right. I know you're right. It's just... I hoped there might be some way to, to, to work it out.~
@54602 = ~Gods damn it... Gods DAMN it! You're right. I know you're right. It's just... I hoped there might be some way to—to—to work it out. If it were just me, I'd follow you to the corners of Toril and beyond. I would.~ [BD54602]
@54603 = ~But it's not just you.~
@54604 = ~If it were just you, I'd let you. You belong with your daughter, Schael. And I don't know where I belong. Not yet.~
@54605 = ~You chose to burden yourself with a child. Now you must live with the consequences of that decision.~
@54606 = ~Thank you, <CHARNAME>. Thank you for everything, but most of all for ending this now, before... before Rohma got hurt. You don't know how much I appreciate that. Maybe someday you will, if you're lucky. Farewell.~ [BD54606]
@54607 = ~And you tell me this now, after everything we've been through, all that I endured on your behalf? You should thank Tymora we're surrounded by witnesses. If we weren't, I'd surely do something we'd both regret.~ [BD54607]
@54608 = ~You got me, all right. You're lucky you didn't get yourself an arrow in the eye. But you'll be getting luckier still, and soon.~
@54609 = ~I will. Happily. I've many regrets, <CHARNAME>. Rohma will never be one of them. Let's go.~
@54610 = ~<CHARNAME>. How are you? ~ [BD54610]
@54611 = ~I've had better days.~
@54612 = ~Corwin. Thank the gods. You've got to get me out of here.~
@54613 = ~You shouldn't be here, Corwin. Go, now.~
@54614 = ~You could have worse. Eltan and Belt moved mountains to keep you alive and out of Entar's hands. ~ [BD54614]
@54615 = ~I need your help, Schael. Let me out of this cell. Let me find Skie Silvershield's killer, let me prove my innocence. Please.~
@54616 = ~I'll be sure to thank them for it when next we meet.~
@54617 = ~If you expect me to thank the Grand Dukes for their hospitality, you're going to be gravely disappointed.~
@54618 = ~Let Entar come. I'll send him to join his wretched daughter.~
@54619 = ~Gods help me. How could I have missed this? How did I never see you for the monster you are?~ [BD54619]
@54620 = ~I was gravely disappointed before I ever came here.~ [BD54620]
@54621 = ~Yet you did come here. Why?~
@54622 = ~I'm not thrilled myself.~
@54623 = ~And yet here you are. Why? Not to free me, I know. You'd never defy your beloved Flaming Fist.~
@54624 = ~And what, you came here seeking solace? I've none to give. I wouldn't offer it to you even if I did. Get out. Your face sickens me. The wretched platitudes you spout make my gut churn. Go!~
@54625 = ~I would have, you know. If you'd asked me, I would have followed you anywhere, happily. It wasn't so long ago. ~ [BD54625]
@54626 = ~I can't do it. I'm sorry, <CHARNAME>. There's only one way you're leaving here.~ [BD54626]
@54627 = ~I didn't kill Skie. You can't believe I'd ever do something like that.~
@54628 = ~I really hope that way involves you letting me out of this cell.~
@54629 = ~Aye. Over the bodies of your friends and colleagues. And yours too, if you stand in my way.~
@54630 = ~If you've not come to help me, why are you here?~
@54631 = ~I don't know what to believe anymore.~ [BD54631]
@54632 = ~The next time you meet the dukes, they'll be standing in judgment over you. I don't think you'll be thanking them.~ [BD54632]
@54633 = ~And you, Schael? Are you here to judge me?~
@54634 = ~That doesn't need to happen. Help me, Schael. Get me out of this cage. We can flee the city, you and me and Rohma.~
@54635 = ~No. I'll be killing them. Every last one of the treacherous swine will fall, ere I'm done.~
@54636 = ~You think I'd turn my back on the Flaming Fist? On my father? I thought you knew me.~ [BD54636]
@54637 = ~I could kill you, <CHARNAME>. If it weren't for Rohma, I'd do it, you know. I would. You need to know how angry I am, to understand the rage I feel.~ [BD54637]
@54638 = ~I didn't kill the girl.~
@54639 = ~I'm not exactly doing a jig here, you know. ~
@54640 = ~You come to me and speak of rage? Come closer, Corwin. I would touch you one last time, and show you what true rage is.~
@54641 = ~Your glib tongue betrays you, <CHARNAME>. A girl lies dead, her blood on your hands, and all you offer is another quip. Skie deserves better than that. As do I.~ [BD54641]
@54642 = ~It doesn't matter. I wish it did, but in the end, it doesn't. If it weren't this, it would have been something else. I thought we could be together, that you and Rohma and I had a future...~ [BD54642]
@54643 = ~Even after everything that's happened in my life, I'm still just a stupid girl, blinded by—whatever it was I thought we had.~ [BD54643]
@54644 = ~It was love, Schael. It was real.~
@54645 = ~Love makes fools of us all.~
@54646 = ~You know what we had. Deny it if you must. I know the truth.~
@54647 = ~You say you loved me. I want to believe it. I do. But I can't.~ [BD54647]
@54648 = ~Love conquers all. I'm not feeling particularly victorious right now. Are you?~ [BD54648]
@54649 = ~I don't. But I still have hope.~
@54650 = ~Don't turn away from me, Schael. I need you.~
@54651 = ~All I feel is the sting of betrayal from one I believed felt for me as I did her.~
@54652 = ~Would that I could say the same. But hope is a luxury I can't allow myself. Not anymore.~ [BD54652]
@54653 = ~We had something, didn't we? I wasn't just fooling myself.~ [BD54653]
@54654 = ~We had everything. And whoever stole it from us will pay a terrible price.~
@54655 = ~If you fooled yourself, I did the same.~
@54656 = ~You tell me. What you do for me here and now—or don't do for me—will let us both know how deep and true your feelings are. Open the door, Corwin. Let me out.~
@54657 = ~Defiant until the end. But you must know this is the end. I'd give anything for that not to be the case, but it is. Accept it, as I have. Find some peace while you're still able.~ [BD54657]
@54658 = ~I—I can't do this. I've got to get out of here, out of this place... Forgive me.~ [BD54658]
@54659 = ~This is the life, isn't it? Breathing fresh air, meeting new people, some of whom aren't trying to kill us, just... adventuring. I love it. Love it. ~ [BD54659]
@54660 = ~I admire your enthusiasm.~
@54661 = ~You are a delightfully mad little person.~
@54662 = ~I wish I shared your passion.~
@54663 = ~Silent or silenced, Gardnersonson. If you aren't one, I promise you will be the other.~
@54664 = ~My enthusiasm is pretty impressive, but don't let it blind you to my other endearing qualities. ~ [BD54664]
@54665 = ~I look forward to learning them firsthand. We will be great friends, Glint Gardnersonson. Or would you rather I call you Three-Eyes?~
@54666 = ~Humility, for instance.~
@54667 = ~You have endearing qualities? I've yet to see them.~
@54668 = ~I try. ~ [BD54668]
@54669 = ~You don't need to try on my behalf.~
@54670 = ~You might want to try a little harder.~
@54671 = ~You try too hard. Your dancing and capering do not amuse me.~
@54672 = ~Oh, I'm not. I am what I am. I couldn't hide that even if I wanted to. Which I don't.~ [BD54672]
@54673 = ~Good. We shall be great friends, you and I. I can tell.~
@54674 = ~I'm glad to hear it. The last thing I want is for you to change. I envy you, truly. Had I but a fraction of the passion you possess, I would do great things.~
@54675 = ~I don't want you to hide, gnome. I want you to shut your gods damned mouth a moment before I shut it permanently.~
@54676 = ~I don't want you to hide. You would do well to shut your gods damned mouth a moment before I shut it permanently, though.~
@54677 = ~Glint Gardnersonson, friends with the hero of Baldur's Gate. Who'd have thought?~ [BD54677]
@54678 = ~Passion? Heh. One thing at a time, <CHARNAME>. Why, we hardly know each other.~ [BD54678]
@54679 = ~You misunderstand me.~
@54680 = ~I look forward to changing that, Three-Eyes.~
@54681 = ~It is perhaps best—and safest for you—that that remain the case.~
@54682 = ~Oh, I understood you perfectly. And I hope you understand me as well. Wink. ~ [BD54682]
@54683 = ~I'm not sure I follow.~
@54684 = ~Wink?~
@54685 = ~Stop talking to me. Now.~
@54686 = ~Then you aren't looking near hard enough. ~ [BD54686]
@54687 = ~That is something I look forward to changing. We are going to be great friends, Three-Eyes.~
@54688 = ~Not all of us have three eyes, Three-Eyes.~
@54689 = ~Nor will I start.~
@54690 = ~Really? Well, that's your decision to make, obviously. But you don't know what you're missing.~ [BD54690]
@54691 = ~Please, call me Glint. Three-Eyes sounds more pleasant on your lips than my mother's, but most of my friends call me Glint. The very close ones call me—well, I don't want to brag.~ [BD54691]
@54692 = ~I'm not trying to amuse you. I cannot be anything but what I am and what I am is... pretty fantastic, if I do say so myself.~ [BD54692]
@54693 = ~Something tells me you say it to yourself often, Three-Eyes.~
@54694 = ~Some things are easier said than done.~
@54695 = ~See that you say it only to yourself. It's obvious you like the sound of your own voice more than I.~
@54696 = ~Ew. Three-Eyes sounds more pleasant on your lips than my mother's, but most of my friends call me Glint. My very close friends call me—well, I don't want to brag. Nor do I need to if you know what I mean.~ [BD54696]
@54697 = ~I could, but I prefer to focus my energies elsewhere, if you know what I mean.~ [BD54697]
@54698 = ~If you don't know what I mean, first, I find that unutterably sad, and second, I'd be happy to show you some time. Just say the word...~ [BD54698]
@54699 = ~Did I say that out loud? Because I absolutely meant to.~ [BD54699]
@54700 = ~Fair enough. There's few things I enjoy more than a challenge. I can see winning you over is going to be one, but I'm up for it.~ [BD54700]
@54701 = ~Ho, <CHARNAME>. Are you having as much fun as me? Because I've got to say, I'm having a lot of fun. Even almost getting horribly slain is relatively enjoyable. As far as that sort of thing goes, I mean.~ [BD54701]
@54702 = ~I wish I felt as you do, Glint. Our conflict with the crusade has already cost the Sword Coast too much. Whoever ultimately wins, we all will have lost.~
@54703 = ~I hear you, friend. I went through six of the Nine Hells fighting Sarevok, but now I'm the hero of Baldur's Gate. What's not to love?~
@54704 = ~I rather enjoy the killing part.~
@54705 = ~I find nothing enjoyable in this. If you do, keep it to yourself. I don't want to hear it.~
@54706 = ~We make a fine pair, don't we, you and me? The hero of Baldur's Gate and his right-hand gnome.~ [BD54706]
@54707 = ~If a finer pair of men have walked the Sword Coast, I've not heard of them.~
@54708 = ~An apt description if ever I've heard one. Of course, I am left-handed...~
@54709 = ~Don't flatter yourself. You serve me no better than any other. If anything, you hold me back.~
@54710 = ~I'm sorry to hear you say that. Sorrier than I'd have thought, actually, but had you said nothing I'd never have thought of you speaking thus.~ [BD54710]
@54711 = ~Apparently, I misunderstood the nature of our relationship. I'll not make that mistake again.~ [BD54711]
@54712 = ~Gods! If I thought as you do I'd have thrown myself from a cliff ages ago. There's misery enough in this world. I'll not add to it, not willingly, and neither should you.~ [BD54712]
@54713 = ~Gods! If I thought as you do, I'd have thrown myself from a cliff ages ago. How you can do what we do and find no joy in it, I'll never understand. In truth, it's not something I care to understand. There's misery enough in this world as it is.~
@54714 = ~Yes, I noticed. Me, I'm a lover, not a fighter. But you've got to take your happiness where you can find it, as my grandmum used to say.~ [BD54714]
@54715 = ~There could be none finer than us. Me, with my wit and charm and looks, and you with... everything you've got.~ [BD54715]
@54716 = ~You don't know what I have to offer? I thought you more perceptive than that.~
@54717 = ~A touch, a touch, I do confess it. I am skewered on your rapier wit. Mercy, please, I beg you.~
@54718 = ~Ow.~
@54719 = ~I've got nothing for you, little man. Now return your lollygagging tongue to your skull before I cut it off.~
@54720 = ~Hah! There's the smile I was looking for. And as always, well worth the effort.~ [BD54720]
@54721 = ~My apologies, <CHARNAME>. If I gave offense, please believe there was none intended. Apparently, I misunderstood the nature of our relationship. I'll not make that mistake again.~ [BD54721]
@54722 = ~Oh dear. I... I don't feel so well. ~ [BD54722]
@54723 = ~Glint? What's the matter?~
@54724 = ~How not well is not so well?~
@54725 = ~Pull it together, Glint. This is no place for the faint of heart.~
@54726 = ~You say that as though someone cares.~
@54727 = ~Did I not mention not feeling so well? I could've sworn I had... ~ [BD54727]
@54728 = ~Could you be a little more specific?~
@54729 = ~You're not feeling so bad that you've lost your sense of humor.~
@54730 = ~I try to be nice and what do I get for it?~
@54731 = ~Suffer in silence, Gardnersonson. I don't want to hear it.~
@54732 = ~I'm tired, <CHARNAME>. I'm so, SO tired. I don't think I got enough sleep the last time we rested. Or any sleep at all, now that I think of it.~ [BD54732]
@54733 = ~What? Why not?~
@54734 = ~Do you need to rest?~
@54735 = ~If you think we're stopping to rest on your account, you'd best think again.~
@54736 = ~You were lying right there. I was... entranced. I didn't want to close my eyes. I was afraid I'd open them and you'd be gone. ~ [BD54736]
@54737 = ~I'd never abandon you, Glint. You're my right-hand gnome.~
@54738 = ~Seriously?~
@54739 = ~You have the soul of a poet. I despise poets.~
@54740 = ~In all my years I don't believe I've heard anything quite so pathetic as that.~
@54741 = ~No, not really. But I was watching you. And then you—I think you started dreaming. Whatever was happening, it wasn't good. So I stayed awake, to make sure you were all right. ~ [BD54741]
@54742 = ~As any good right-hand gnome would. You are a true friend, Glint.~
@54743 = ~That's moderately disturbing. In a charming way, to be sure, but even so.~
@54744 = ~Take care of yourself, little man, and leave me to do the same.~
@54745 = ~Surely the hero of Baldur's Gate is accustomed to having the eyes of others upon <PRO_HIMHER>? Not that that's why I was looking at you. Fame is fleeting. What draws me to you has more substance than that.~ [BD54745]
@54746 = ~Give me a moment, please. I just need a few seconds to clear my mind and find a little focus.~ [BD54746]
@54747 = ~Whatever time you need, my friend. I wouldn't want you feeling any less than your best when we face the trials ahead.~
@54748 = ~Just a little, I hope. Your addled pate is part of your charm.~
@54749 = ~Take as long as you want. In fact, take longer. Stay here. I'll fetch you when I've done what I came to do. Perhaps.~
@54750 = ~Only because I thought someone might. Thanks for straightening that out for me.~ [BD54750]
@54751 = ~If you can't laugh, you've got nothing.~ [BD54751]
@54752 = ~Misery loves company, <CHARNAME>. And the way I feel right now, you're good company indeed.~ [BD54752]
@54753 = ~Right. I'll stay here then, get some rest. It'll be easier to do without you around to distract me.~ [BD54753]
@54754 = ~I am, aren't I? But your right-hand gnome's letting you down right now.~ [BD54754]
@54755 = ~Of course, of course. I just need to pick up the pieces a bit, move from totally shattered to my more typical mildly fragmented.~ [BD54755]
@54756 = ~And now I have. Thank you for your patience, <CHARNAME>. I appreciate it. But that's enough time wasted—let's be about our business, eh?~ [BD54756]
@54757 = ~There are some who'd appreciate the sentiment. I thought you might be one of them. You have my thanks for straightening that out.~ [BD54757]
@54758 = ~I'm feeling better by the second. Give me a minute and I'll be ready to take on the crusade single-handed. Which would probably get me killed. So give me half a minute—then we can face the crusade together. I'm more likely to survive that way, and if I don't, I can think of worse places to die than at your side.~ [BD54758]
@54759 = ~So <CHARNAME>, there's something I can't help but notice about you of late... ~ [BD54759]
@54760 = ~Oh?~
@54761 = ~Just one thing? I'd have hoped you noticed a bit more than that.~
@54762 = ~If you couldn't help but notice it, you've been looking too closely. Cast your eyes elsewhere—preferably somewhere they'll do some good.~
@54763 = ~Your eye seems to have been... wandering. Some looks you've given other people make me uneasy.~ [BD54763]
@54764 = ~My eyes do more than wander—they rove, they explore, looking for possibilities in each situation I find myself in. I'd be dead a dozen times over were it otherwise.~
@54765 = ~Is my right-hand gnome feeling underappreciated? That is adorable.~
@54766 = ~You want me to what, close my eyes as we hunt the most dangerous woman on the Sword Coast?~
@54767 = ~That is a problem for you to resolve. When you do, let me know.~
@54768 = ~Of course I notice the—you know, the usual things. They're hard to miss, especially when you're looking for them as hard as I do. But...~ [BD54768]
@54769 = ~Don't tease. Well, tease, but don't tease in quite that way.~ [BD54769]
@54770 = ~How would you like to be teased?~
@54771 = ~Come here and I'll tease you some more. You'll like it, I promise.~
@54772 = ~In seriousness, then: This neediness is beneath you, and worse, it wearies me. My eyes go where they will, as I do. If you take issue with that, our friendship will not last.~
@54773 = ~I did like that. All right. Well. I'm feeling better about things. Let's, uh... Let's do whatever it is we're here to do again. Yeah?~ [BD54773]
@54774 = ~I didn't realize my gaze was so unwelcome. Forgive me. In future I'll try to keep my thoughts to myself.~ [BD54774]
@54775 = ~I'll believe that when I see it, gnome—perhaps not even then. If I cut your tongue from your mouth and your fingers from your hands, still you'd find a way to make your thoughts known. It's a weakness of your character: You cannot help yourself.~
@54776 = ~I don't want you to close your eyes. I WOULD, however, prefer your gaze linger longer upon me and less upon our friends.~ [BD54776]
@54777 = ~Know this, then, and may the gods strike me down if I lie: Had I the option, I would look at nothing and no one but you. You're the one I want, Glint, you and no other. Come here now, and kiss me.~
@54778 = ~You're an attractive man, Glint, but eyes can see danger as well as beauty.~
@54779 = ~My eyes will wander where they will, as will my hands, as will every other part of me.~
@54780 = ~I've demanded nothing of you yet. Rest assured I won't change that any time soon.~
@54781 = ~That's not the sort of looking I mean and you know it isn't.~ [BD54781]
@54782 = ~I merely tried to make a point. Yes, on occasion my gaze alights upon another. But never doubt I would be happier had I no option but to look at you, and only you. If you want proof, it's here on my lips. Here, let me show you.~
@54783 = ~You really are upset, aren't you? Forgive me, Glint. Tell me how I can allay these fears.~
@54784 = ~My eyes go where they will, as do I. If you've a problem with that, our friendship will not last.~
@54785 = ~You don't know? Come here, then. Let me give you an example.~ [BD54785]
@54786 = ~Maglubiyet's fist! I don't want to listen to this mush.~ [BD54786]
@54787 = ~You'd throw it all away, just like that? I thought—I hoped what we shared, what I thought we shared, would mean more to you. You are right. Best we end this now and save ourselves regret later.~ [BD54787]
@54788 = ~You know, I really think I must love you, <CHARNAME>. There aren't many men I'd follow into one of the Nine Hells. ~ [BD54788]
@54789 = ~Most would end up having to follow you. You have a habit of rushing in where solars and sensible folk fear to tread.~
@54790 = ~Flattery will get you everywhere. Specifically, it'll get you into one of the Nine Hells. It's possible flattery wasn't the best idea in this case.~
@54791 = ~Love means nothing where we're going.~
@54792 = ~What's the point of moving if you know where you're going to end up? ~
@54793 = ~In a thousand years I'd never have guessed I'd end up in Avernus.~
@54794 = ~Avoiding going to places like Avernus.~
@54795 = ~Precisely the sort of fuzzy thinking that gets people killed.~
@54796 = ~I regret nothing! Sure, I face the legions of Avernus, but at least I'm doing so with decent company. I've faced worse than this in my time. ~ [BD54792]
@54797 = ~I can think of no one I'd rather charge into the Nine Hells with than you.~
@54798 = ~You have?~
@54799 = ~I regret little, but throwing my lot in with a mad gnome might qualify.~
@54800 = ~I always figured there was a chance. Could be worse, though. At least I've some decent company. That's always better than traveling alone, don't you think? ~ [BD54800]
@54801 = ~I can think of no one I'd rather charge into the Nine Hells with than you.~
@54802 = ~Perhaps we could wait till after we've escaped the pit before we discuss the relative merits of traveling companions.~
@54803 = ~It depends entirely who one's traveling with. I'm increasingly of the opinion that I made a serious error including you in this venture.~
@54804 = ~No.~
@54805 = ~You need to relax, <CHARNAME>. Embrace the unknown. Take a deep breath—actually, don't do that, the last thing you need is sulfur-filled lungs. Hey, did I ever tell you about the time I explored the tunnels under Waterdeep?~ [BD54805]
@54806 = ~You always say the nicest things. Come here a second. I'm not thrilled with the idea of a fiery death, but I'd be even less thrilled if I didn't take the chance to kiss you before it.~ [BD54806]
@54807 = ~Ah, it's only a Hell. I've faced worse.~ [BD54807]
@54808 = ~You have?~
@54809 = ~You liar. You lying lying liar...~
@54810 = ~You'll face me if you don't shut your mouth and focus on the task at hand.~
@54811 = ~I have! When I was just a lad, I was exploring a cavern under Waterdeep at the behest of a lovely older man who taught me—maybe I'll save that for another time.~ [BD54811]
@54812 = ~Epic tale of adventure and romance short, I stumbled into a portal to the Abyss. You think Avernus is bad? The Nine Hells have rules. The Abyss is a riddle wrapped in a mystery, inside an enigma that's been swallowed by utter bloody chaos.~ [BD54812]
@54813 = ~I got out of that using nothing but my wits. We'll get through Avernus too.~ [BD54813]
@54814 = ~I believe you.~
@54815 = ~If you believe that, I've got a bridge over the Blood River to sell you.~
@54816 = ~Avernus will be the least of your worries if you don't shut your damned mouth!~
@54817 = ~That's what I like about you, <CHARNAME>. You're so delightfully gullible. C'mere. One more kiss and we'll go finish this.~ [BD54817]
@54818 = ~Aaaand let's go finish this.~ [BD54818]
@54819 = ~Let's go find out, shall we?~ [BD54819]
@54820 = ~Love means everything, no matter where you are. If you don't understand that—I don't even know who you are. I guess I'm about to find out, aren't I?~ [BD54820]
@54821 = ~Fair point. But if it doesn't get you killed, it can take you to some fun and interesting places. And also Avernus. Well, they can't all be winners.~ [BD54821]
@54822 = ~Well, that's... disappointing. Let's go finish this, then, and quickly. I wouldn't want to keep you from your precious solitude.~ [BD54822]
@54823 = ~Look, <CHARNAME>, I don't want to tell you your business, but maybe it's not the best idea to insult a close friend and ally seconds before you face the legions of Avernus. Just putting that out there. Do with it what you will. In the meantime, let's go see an end to this.~ [BD54823]
@54824 = ~Oh, do you think we'll get to see the Blood River? That would be amazing. What're we waiting for? Let's do this!~ [BD54824]
@54825 = ~Heya. ~ [BD54825]
@54826 = ~It's you, Glint. I feared—I was afraid I'd never see you again.~
@54827 = ~Glint! Thank the gods. Get this door open.~
@54828 = ~Go away, Glint. I don't want to talk to you.~
@54829 = ~Don't. Don't say that word. It's not for you.~
@54830 = ~Don't do this, <CHARNAME>. Not now. ~ [BD54830]
@54831 = ~What would you have me do, then? Thrash and rage and scream at the injustice of it all?~
@54832 = ~Nothing good can come of your being here. I don't want you to see me like this. Leave me to my misery, I beg you.~
@54833 = ~I said go. Get out of here!~
@54834 = ~I'd not deny any man, much less you, his final wish, especially one so easily provided as this. Goodbye, <CHARNAME>. We'll not meet again, I think. But I dearly hope I'm wrong.~ [BD54834]
@54835 = ~Do you think that would help?~ [BD54835]
@54836 = ~No.~
@54837 = ~It couldn't hurt.~
@54838 = ~Not nearly as much as freeing me from this cell would. Open the door. Release me.~
@54839 = ~I wouldn't, then. ~ [BD54839]
@54840 = ~Why are you here, Glint?~
@54841 = ~Hey, you know what would help is getting me out of this bloody cell. Anything you can do for me on that?~
@54842 = ~Enough talk. Open the cell door. Release me.~
@54843 = ~I've tried to let it go, <CHARNAME>. I have, truly, but I can't. I need to know what there was between you and the Silvershield girl. ~ [BD54843]
@54844 = ~Nothing. There was nothing between us. I didn't kill her, Glint. I couldn't have.~
@54845 = ~In the end? A dagger's hilt and not much else.~
@54846 = ~You think I killed her? I wish I had. I'll swing for her death regardless of the truth.~
@54847 = ~This isn't a joke!~
@54848 = ~I would if I could. Well, I suppose I'm technically capable of pulling it off. What I mean is, I would if I could and not get cut down by the small army of Flaming Fist mercenaries down the hall who're clearly looking for any excuse to cut down a dashing gnome in the prime of his life.~ [BD54848]
@54849 = ~I am so sorry. I've been trying to find a way to get you out of here that wouldn't end up with both of us prematurely dead. I plan to keep trying until I find one.~ [BD54849]
@54850 = ~If you aren't here to free me, why have you come?~
@54851 = ~You'll find a way, I'm sure. I have faith in you.~
@54852 = ~Go, then. Go and don't return until you're able to release me from this fetid hole.~
@54853 = ~I'd give it a try, then. Preferably after I leave. ~ [BD54853]
@54854 = ~You haven't come to free me?~
@54855 = ~I assume you mean after WE leave.~
@54856 = ~You intend to abandon me too, then. I suppose I should have expected nothing better.~
@54857 = ~I could say I love you, and I wouldn't be lying. But I would be lying if I said I loved you more than I do living. There's a Flaming Fist army down the hall who're clearly looking for any excuse to cut down a dashing gnome in the prime of his life.~ [BD54857]
@54858 = ~Goodbye. If we don't see each other again, I—I want you to know the time we spent together was, it was... I'm sorry. I can't do this. Forgive me. I can't.~ [BD54858]
