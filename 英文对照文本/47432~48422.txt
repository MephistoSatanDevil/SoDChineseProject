I could cut these druids free from the roots.

A pair of druids seem to be caught in a snare of animate roots. It shouldn't be too hard to cut them loose.~

I should look for the roots of an underground tree where I can plant these enchanted seeds.

Jamven and Chorster, a pair of druids, want my help in defeating their enemy. Ferrusk is a dark druid who exiled Jamven and Chorster from the underground river caverns. I need to find the dark druid circle and plant the enchanted seed I received in its roots.~

The dark druid circle is destroyed.

I destroyed the dark druid circle by planting the enchanted seed in its roots. Jamven and Chorster can already feel the forest healing.~

I've slain the druids who attacked me.

I've concluded my dealings with the druids.

Druids revere nature beneath the ground as much as they do nature above the ground, it seems. The caverns below this area contain a vibrant ecosystem that the druids are willing to spend their lives protecting... and fighting over.~

@47686 = ~He didn't do it, you know. I don't believe he did it. Corinth wouldn't be so foolish as to betray us. ~
@47687 = ~You believe Valis lies when she claims Corinth warned Innisfall of the crusade's arrival?~
@47688 = ~Slow down there. Who is this Corinth you speak of?~
@47689 = ~Good to know. Nice talking to you. I'll be on my way now.~
@47690 = ~Who are you talking about?~
@47691 = ~He refers to a ranger accused of betraying the crusade. Their commander, Leopas, tasked you with determining the truth of the accusations, remember?~ [BD47691]
@47692 = ~You aren't here to talk to me about Corinth? I thought Commander Leopas had you looking into Valis's claims—which aren't true. I don't think they're true, anyway. I just don't.~
@47693 = ~You think Valis is lying?~
@47694 = ~Ah, yes. I remember now.~
@47695 = ~Your opinion on the matter—on any matter—means nothing to me. Fare you well.~
@47696 = ~Didn't say that, didn't say that. Just saying she's not telling the truth for some reason. Don't know why. Maybe even she doesn't know why.~
@47697 = ~Look, Corinth isn't the most steadfast guy around; I know that. I know that. He's in this for the money, not the mission. But he's in it, see? He's in it. So he's got—had, so he had family in Innisfall. That doesn't prove anything.~
@47698 = ~Corinth has family in Innisfall?~
@47699 = ~Indeed it doesn't. You have my thanks. We may speak again.~
@47700 = ~Cease your prattling, you gibbering wretch! I don't want to hear it!~
@47701 = ~Yeah, all right, may Caelar's light guide you always and like that.~
@47702 = ~Corinth has family in Innisfall? Where'd you hear that?~
@47703 = ~You said it just now.~
@47704 = ~You hadn't heard about that? Everyone's talking about it.~
@47705 = ~This is ridiculous. I'll not waste any more time on you.~
@47706 = ~Well, yeah, he had family in Innisfall. And Innisfall managed to, you know, run like the hells just a few minutes before the crusade arrived. That doesn't prove anything. Nothing, that's what it proves. What I'm saying, if you listen to me, what I'm saying is, Corinth isn't gonna turn on the crusade. He just isn't. FACT. ~
@47707 = ~You've been most helpful. Thank you.~
@47708 = ~I believe you. Now if you'll excuse me, I'll be on my way.~
@47709 = ~Are you finished talking? Because I assure you, I am done listening.~
@47710 = ~They are? Really? Huh.~
@47711 = ~He wouldn't turn on us. He wouldn't. Uh, what...?~
@47712 = ~Hm? What? Oh! It's you. He didn't do it. ~
@47713 = ~Yes, you mentioned that earlier. It was most helpful.~
@47714 = ~Who didn't do what?~
@47715 = ~I'm afraid he did.~
@47716 = ~No. We are not going to go through this again.~
@47717 = ~So you're gonna tell Leopas Corinth is innocent? ~
@47718 = ~I'll tell him the truth.~
@47719 = ~I haven't decided yet.~
@47720 = ~Corinth isn't innocent.~
@47721 = ~Yeah, sure, sure. The truth. That should work. Good. I'll see you later, then.~
@47722 = ~Fair enough, fair enough, yeah, that's fair. Good. I'll see you later then, right? Good.~
@47723 = ~Aw, naw, naw, no, you think he did it? Betrayed the crusade? No. Uh-uh. Not him. He's not that stupid.~
@47724 = ~Ho, there. I am Damarr. ~
@47725 = ~I am <CHARNAME>. Pleased to make your acquaintance.~
@47726 = ~Good to know you, Damarr. I'm investigating the charges against Corinth.~
@47727 = ~And I am leaving.~
@47728 = ~Seriously? <CHARNAME>? You know you share a name with the hero of Baldur's Gate, right?~
@47729 = ~I am aware of it.~
@47730 = ~Painfully so. I loathe that <PRO_MANWOMAN>, <PRO_HESHE>'s made my life a living nightmare.~
@47731 = ~This is not a conversation I care to have.~
@47732 = ~You may want to consider calling yourself something else. The Baldur's Gate <CHARNAME> is... not beloved 'round here.~
@47733 = ~I see. What can I help you with?~
@47734 = ~What can you tell me about Valis and Corinth?~
@47735 = ~Nothing at the moment.~
@47736 = ~Do you think Corinth warned Innisfall about the crusade?~
@47737 = ~Were they both to die, I'd not mourn their loss.~
@47738 = ~Hold thy tongue, girl. You do not know to whom you speak.~ [BD47738]
@47739 = ~I'm sorry, I thought you were the one assigned to determine Corinth's guilt.~
@47740 = ~I am tasked with that duty, it is true.~
@47741 = ~Oh, Corinth! Right. I thought you said—something else. Yes. I am looking into that. You know him? Or Valis?~
@47742 = ~I am. I was trying to make a joke. In retrospect, I see that wasn't the best idea. So do you know them? Could Corinth have betrayed the crusade?~
@47743 = ~This is not something I wish to discuss. Farewell.~
@47744 = ~I know them both well enough, I think. ~
@47745 = ~Do you believe Corinth did what Valis claims?~
@47746 = ~Any insights you'd care to share?~
@47747 = ~What do you know of them? Tell me everything.~
@47748 = ~Nice talking to you.~
@47749 = ~All right, here's how it is. It's no secret Corinth isn't as... committed to Caelar's cause as some of us. Certainly not the way Valis is. Could he have warned Innisfall about the crusade coming?~
@47750 = ~It's possible. It's definitely possible. But—it's not like we lost people taking Innisfall. It's not SO great a crime that he deserves to die—assuming he even did anything, which I don't think you can assume.~
@47751 = ~Would Valis lie to frame Corinth? She obviously holds him in contempt.~
@47752 = ~I'm not assuming anything. Belief is not enough for me—I have to KNOW what's true and what isn't.~
@47753 = ~I assume nothing.~
@47754 = ~Valis has no love for Corinth. I don't know how far she'd go to see him dead. And we are talking about Corinth's life and death here. If he's found guilty of betraying Caelar, he'll be heading to Avernus before any of us do.~
@47755 = ~Heh. I can see how you might end up feeling that way.~
@47756 = ~Do you know them? Any insight you can offer would be much appreciated.~
@47757 = ~It's been... something. I'm not sure what it's been, and it smells pretty bad, but it's definitely something.~
@47758 = ~I don't wish to speak of this right now. Perhaps later.~
@47759 = ~Is there anything I can do to help?~
@47760 = ~I've seen enough death myself. I don't like Corinth, but I don't dislike him so much that I'd see him die, not for what he's accused of.~
@47761 = ~Thank you, Damarr. You've been very helpful.~
@47762 = ~You've given me a lot to think about.~
@47763 = ~I've had enough of this. Perhaps we shall speak more of it another time. For now, however, I will take my leave.~
@47764 = ~I try. Take care of yourself. Caelar's enemies are all around us. We are safe in her light, but... well, we could always be a little safer, you know? ~
@47765 = ~Back for more? ~
@47766 = ~I would speak to you about Valis and Corinth.~
@47767 = ~No, I'm really not.~
@47768 = ~Yeah. I'm still trying to figure out this thing with the rangers.~
@47769 = ~You have more to give?~
@47770 = ~Yes. You seem very reasonable for a crusader.~
@47771 = ~I've nothing more to say to you.~
@47772 = ~A pity. I enjoyed our time together. Fare thee well.~
@47773 = ~Valis, Corinth, Valis, Corinth, I'm sick of hearing those names. Do people talk about anyone else around here?~ [BD47773]
@47774 = ~This is wisdom. Take care.~
@47775 = ~No more reasonable than you, surely?~
@47776 = ~I sometimes have... doubts, about Caelar's goals. Not their righteousness, necessarily, but whether they're actually achievable.~
@47777 = ~Much more reasonable than that, I'd hope. Excuse me, I've got to go figure this thing with Valis and Corinth out.~
@47778 = ~No, no more reasonable than me. Who is a crusader. Yes.~
@47779 = ~Far more reasonable than me. Believe me, you have no idea how insane I really am.~
@47780 = ~I am here for my own benefit. In that, I seem to be a minority. Most of our fellows seem more than willing to die for the Shining Lady.~
@47781 = ~It's true. You really don't.~ [BD47781]
@47782 = ~It's all right. Not all of us are blinded by Caelar's light. Most are, it's true. You don't march into a Hell if you don't BELIEVE, no matter how much you're being paid.~
@47783 = ~You aren't?~
@47784 = ~I'm surprised to hear you say this. I thought I was the only one who wasn't, shall we say, a true believer.~
@47785 = ~Really? Tell me more.~
@47786 = ~Most are, it's true. You don't march into a Hell if you don't BELIEVE, no matter how much you're being paid.~
@47787 = ~But I've been here a month. Haven't gone to Avernus yet. When the time comes... Well, we'll see how many truly follow Caelar then. If it happens.~
@47788 = ~Take care of yourself, Damarr. There are dark times ahead.~
@47789 = ~I hope she's right and all this is in service to the greater good.~
@47790 = ~I can't imagine it'll be much longer before we know what's happening. For myself, I will focus on survival.~
@47791 = ~Darker for some than for others.~
@47792 = ~Do my eyes deceive me? Are you actually flirting with this creature, <CHARNAME>?~ [BD47792]
@47793 = ~This isn't the time and it definitely isn't the place. Let's go.~
@47794 = ~No harm in a little flirting. It's what comes later that can be dangerous. I'll leave you to your business now. Take care.~
@47795 = ~And better days beyond them. We just have to survive long enough to enjoy them. It was good talking with you. Perhaps we can do it again sometime.~
@47796 = ~You and me both. Take care of yourself. Perhaps we'll talk again when this is all over.~
@47797 = ~Nothing you've not heard many times before, I'm sure. Nice talking to you. Take care.~
@47798 = ~Yes, <PRO_SIRMAAM>! What can I do for you this fine <DAYNIGHTALL>?~
@47799 = ~You know what's happening with Valis and Corinth?~
@47800 = ~I'm looking for Caelar.~
@47801 = ~Do you know where I could get a drink around here? I am parched.~
@47802 = ~Nothing. Go away. Now.~
@47803 = ~I know sheep dung from my mam's good silver!~
@47804 = ~I know sheep dung from my mam's good silver! Valis says Corinth warned Innisfall the crusade was a-coming and lost us potential conscripts and supplies. Now, Corinth never took a shine to me. Says Caelar's got her hand up my backside—I wish!—and I don't have a thought of my own in my head.~
@47805 = ~But Valis, she don't think too highly of me neither. One time we were marching through the Troll Claws and she put porridge in my boots while I was asleep. Well, she said it was porridge. I didn't want to look too closely, you know what I mean?~
@47806 = ~I guess what I'm saying is, I don't know whether Corinth did what Valis says or not, and I wouldn't be too sad if the pair of 'em took a flying leap off the edge of Toril!~
@47807 = ~That was... most enlightening. Thank you.~
@47808 = ~That was no help whatsoever, but thanks for trying.~
@47809 = ~I am beginning to agree with you. You may go now.~
@47810 = ~No problem, no problem at all, anything for a fellow servant of the Lady. Hey—may Caelar shine upon you! Take care now!~
@47811 = ~I could go; I could do that, yes, <PRO_SIRMAAM>, but then I'd be the one Leopas was looking at cock-eyed. He told me to man my post! So I'll just stay here if it's all the same to you. May the Shining Lady's light guide you always!~
@47812 = ~Lots of people are! She got here a week, maybe two weeks, maybe three weeks, maybe a month or more ago and went into Dragonspear. As far as I know, she's still in there.~
@47813 = ~Thank you. You've been most helpful.~
@47814 = ~Have you any thoughts on this matter with Valis and Corinth? You know them?~
@47815 = ~As far as you know?~
@47816 = ~Interesting. You may leave.~
@47817 = ~It's not like I'm part of her inner circle. I wish, you know? But no, no, I'm just a normal fella, I'm not outstanding in my field, so here I am, out standing in the field! Hey, you take care of yourself now, you hear? May Caelar guide you and yours from the darkness.~
@47818 = ~Ja! This crusading, she is thirsty work. Old Voghiln wouldn't say no to a mug of ale. And he'd say "ja ja ja" to a cask of it, ho ho!~ [BD47818]
@47819 = ~Now that is a good question. I'm not a man of the grape, if you know what I mean. I mean I'm no great drinker of anything that's not water. But I hear there's a dwarf—it's always a dwarf, isn't it?—there's a dwarf named Heath Lodefinder; they say you want a drink, he's the man to talk to.~
@47820 = ~You have yourself a great <DAYNIGHTALL> now. May you be worthy in the Shining Lady's eyes.~
@47821 = ~Yeah? What do you want? ~
@47822 = ~Good <DAYNIGHTALL> to you. I seek Caelar Argent. Do you know where I might find her?~
@47823 = ~Do you know Valis or Corinth? One of them is lying about the other. I'm trying to figure out which is which.~
@47824 = ~I have an urgent message for the Shining Lady. Tell me where she is.~
@47825 = ~I want many things, none of which you can provide.~
@47826 = ~Aye, I know, but knowing'll do you no good. She speaks to no one but her closest advisors of late.~
@47827 = ~She's in the castle, but you'll not find it easy to reach her. And by not easy, I really mean impossible. She speaks to no one but Hephernaan and the Revered Brothers of late. But hey, luck to you.~
@47828 = ~I'm sorry to hear that. But as I can provide nothing to you, perhaps you'd best push off, yeah?~
@47829 = ~Corinth is your best bet there. Valis is many things, most of them unpleasant, but she's no liar. That one doesn't have the patience for deception, or much else, truth be told.~
@47830 = ~Thank you. That's very helpful.~
@47831 = ~I know exactly what you mean. I talked to her. Thanks for the help.~
@47832 = ~You see much but speak little. I like that. I am in your debt.~
@47833 = ~Weren't nothing. If it were something, I'd have charged you for it. Be off with you now. ~
@47834 = ~There something I can help you with? ~
@47835 = ~I seek the Lady Caelar Argent.~
@47836 = ~Only if you have any insight into either Valis or Corinth.~
@47837 = ~Nothing at all.~
@47838 = ~Move along, then. Make yourself useful. But do it somewhere else.~
@47839 = ~Give it a day, maybe two, and it'll be the gods' problem. Valis'll put an arrow in Corinth's back first chance she gets.~
@47840 = ~Give it a day, maybe two, and it'll be the gods' problem. Valis'll put an arrow in Corinth's back first chance she gets. It's a shame, really. He's not a bad sort. Mind you, I wouldn't want to be partnered with him. Lazy bugger, or so they say.~
@47841 = ~I've heard people say that, yes.~
@47842 = ~Who's they?~
@47843 = ~They say that, do they?~
@47844 = ~Nobody. Just people. You know.~
@47845 = ~Now go, be about your business. You don't want to get caught standing round talking to me. That's just asking someone to rope you into doing something you'd rather not be doing. Take it easy—easy as you can.~
@47846 = ~Like I say, it'll all sort itself out soon enough.~
@47847 = ~They say it, all right. About Corinth? They say it a lot.~
@47848 = ~She's in the castle, but you won't be able to get to her. They say she only talks to that priest of hers, whatsisname, the Revered whatever Hephernaan.~
@47849 = ~Let's hear it then. Did Corinth betray the crusade? Or is Valis bearing false witness against her fellow ranger? ~
@47850 = ~In truth, I cannot say. The available evidence points to Corinth's guilt, but it's hardly compelling enough to justify a man's death.~
@47851 = ~Corinth did as Valis says. He warned Innisfall of our arrival, letting them evade the Shining Lady's grasp.~
@47852 = ~I've talked to enough people to know Valis cannot be trusted. Corinth is innocent.~
@47853 = ~I've given this a lot of thought. Hey, who's kidding who—I've lost sleep over it. But after careful examination of the facts, it's clear to me that Corinth is innocent of the crimes Valis accuses him of.~
@47854 = ~This hasn't been an easy task for me. Hells, who's kidding who? I've lost weight over it. But the truth is clear. Corinth betrayed his fellows at Innisfall.~
@47855 = ~They are both guilty.~
@47856 = ~Both are guilty. They conspired to allow the people of Innisfall to escape. It was only after Corinth threatened to expose them that Valis turned on him, doing as he would have done to her before he had the chance.~
@47857 = ~Deceiver! I'll see you dead for this, you and Corinth both!~ [BD47857]
@47858 = ~Kill her!~
@47859 = ~A regrettable but necessary end to this grim business. There is a lesson here, friends. Learn it well. I'll not tolerate traitors in our ranks. Go, reflect on what you've seen and prepare to see more of it. Soon we will face our enemies.~ [BD47859]
@47860 = ~You have done me and the crusade a service ferreting out Valis's lies. All that she possessed is yours now.~
@47861 = ~You have done me a service. Thank you. As a reward, all that Corinth possessed is now yours.~
@47862 = ~I didn't, I swear I didn't!~
@47863 = ~I knew it! Let justice be done!~ [BD47863]
@47864 = ~Slay the traitor.~
@47865 = ~How is this possible? Explain yourself. ~
@47866 = ~They conspired together to allow the people of Innisfall to escape. Only after Corinth threatened to reveal their crime did Valis turn on him, doing as he would have done to her before he had the chance.~
@47867 = ~Oh, you want me to explain my decision? I thought you'd just, you know—accept it.~
@47868 = ~I owe you no explanations. This is my judgment, accept it or don't.~
@47869 = ~You think this a joke? Get out of my sight, you repellent dullard! And thank Caelar for watching over you—were we anywhere but here, you'd pay dearly for wasting my time with such nonsense!~
@47870 = ~Don't think he likes you.~ [BD47870]
@47871 = ~I hope you're pleased with yourself, <CHARNAME>. We've gained little playing this fool's game.~
@47872 = ~I see. Very well. Both Corinth and Valis are guilty. Slay them, in Caelar's name!~
@47873 = ~You've wasted my time. Thank Caelar for watching over you. In another place, at another time, I wouldn't hesitate to cut you down. Go, make yourself useful, if you can. I don't want to see you again.~
@47874 = ~I said I didn't want to see your face again. Begone.~
@47875 = ~Forgive me, sir. I'll be on my way.~
@47876 = ~Actually, you just said you didn't want to see me again. You didn't specify that it was my face that offended you. If I turn my back to you, we'll be all right, then?~
@47877 = ~We don't always get what we want.~
@47878 = ~Get out of here, you idiot halfwit!~
@47879 = ~I'll cut that jester's tongue from your skull, you gabbling buffoon!~
@47880 = ~Good. Be off with you.~
@47881 = ~Might I have a word? ~
@47882 = ~Of course, Corinth. What can I do for you?~
@47883 = ~Depends on the word. If it's "die!", you can keep it.~
@47884 = ~Take two: Go away.~
@47885 = ~There is much I'd say to you, but I'll not deny the one who saved my life a request as simple as that. Farewell.~ [BD47885]
@47886 = ~It seems I owe you my life. I'm—I'm not really sure how much that's worth, these days.~
@47887 = ~All life has value, Corinth. You have to believe that.~
@47888 = ~Then make it worth something. Do what you must do to find meaning in your actions.~
@47889 = ~It means little enough to me. Begone.~
@47890 = ~I thought I could manage this. Fight for Caelar, for the greater good. That was what I wanted to do. Her cause is righteous. I believe in her, but... Some of the things I've seen in her service... Some of the things I've done... ~
@47891 = ~You don't need to do this, Corinth. You may not be able to stop the crusade, but no one can make you be a part of it.~
@47892 = ~We do what we must to survive.~
@47893 = ~War is father to many an atrocity.~
@47894 = ~What have you done, really? I'll tell you: nothing. You know nothing of the true horrors this world has to offer. Begone; I'll hear no more of this pitiful whining.~
@47895 = ~No one's ever accused me of being a proud man. But I've never felt like this, never felt ashamed before. I hope Caelar succeeds. I hope the souls of the dead are restored. But I can't be a part of it. Not anymore.~
@47896 = ~First chance I get, I'm leaving this place. Running may not seem very noble, but it's the best I can do. This is all—it's too much. It's too big for the likes of me.~
@47897 = ~My father gave me this bow. I'd like you to have it. Please. It's all I have to offer you as thanks for helping me. I don't deserve to carry it. I won't need it where I'm going anyway. Farewell.~
@47898 = ~Attention!~
@47899 = ~Right turn!~
@47900 = ~By the left! Quick march!~
@47901 = ~Halt!~
@47902 = ~About turn!~
@47903 = ~Stand easy!~
@47904 = ~What a bunch of pathetic babies! I've never seen a worse lot in my entire career! ~ [BD48454]
@47905 = ~Troubles, Vigilant?~
@47906 = ~They're pretty terrible.~
@47907 = ~These incompetents will cause more deaths on our side than the enemy's.~
@47908 = ~You said it. They're a Daggerford detail—not used to the experience and discipline we get in Waterdeep.~
@47909 = ~Will you be able to whip them into shape?~
@47910 = ~You should send them back to Daggerford.~
@47911 = ~Place them at the front of the unit. They'll die in the first charge, but at least they'll tire the enemy out.~
@47912 = ~I'm doing my best, but I've other duties to attend to. This lot might have to get by on their own.~
@47913 = ~Ha! You've a wicked sense of humor there. You are joking, yes...?~
@47914 = ~I'd love to send them back to Daggerford but we need every soldier we can get. Even ones as useless as these.~
@47915 = ~Perhaps I could try training them for you?~
@47916 = ~Why don't I take over training for a bit? I certainly can't make them any worse.~
@47917 = ~Let me take a run at them. I'll show them real discipline.~
@47918 = ~Good luck with them, Vigilant. I have to be going.~
@47919 = ~I'll do my best. All right, troops, keep at it!~
@47920 = ~You're the hero of Baldur's Gate. Why not? Come talk to me when you've finished drilling 'em and we'll see how you did. Dismissed!~ [BD47920]
@47921 = ~Come talk to me when you've drilled all six of the soldiers and I'll see how you did. Dismissed!~
@47922 = ~I understand you'll be training me. ~
@47923 = ~That's right. Let's see what you can do, soldier. Attack one of your comrades!~
@47924 = ~Yes, <PRO_SIRMAAM>!~
@47925 = ~Whoa! Slow down there, soldier. You're out of control.~
@47926 = ~I think you killed them, soldier.~
@47927 = ~That sort of uncontrolled attack will get you and everyone around you killed.~
@47928 = ~Sorry, <PRO_SIRMAAM>. I got a little carried away. ~
@47929 = ~If you can control and focus that energy, you'll be deadly on the battlefield. Let me show you some techniques. Hold your sword like this...~
@47930 = ~Rage is an asset in battle—IF it's focused. Let me show you how I'd destroy an enemy...~
@47931 = ~Your fighting style reminds me of my own. You enjoy killing, don't you? ~
@47932 = ~You need to calm down. Focus your attacks. Let's try this again.~
@47933 = ~Try holding your sword in your other hand. That will slow you down and make you think about what you're doing.~
@47934 = ~I sense something in you, soldier. A darkness that reminds me of my own. You like killing, don't you?~
@47935 = ~I... yes. I do enjoy it. I thought if I said so, though, they wouldn't let me in the militia.~
@47936 = ~Give in to that desire. Don't try to suppress your true nature. As you slay your enemies, you'll hear a calling in your soul. Answer it, if you dare.~
@47937 = ~I... I will. Thank you.~
@47938 = ~I... yes. I do enjoy it. I thought if I said so, though, they wouldn't let me in the militia.~
@47939 = ~You are what you are. Any attempt to suppress your true nature is doomed to fail. As you slay your enemies, you'll hear a calling in your soul. Answer it, if you dare.~
@47940 = ~How's this?~
@47941 = ~Much better. Keep practicing, soldier. ~
@47942 = ~Uh, okay. I guess I could try that. ~
@47943 = ~Keep practicing, soldier! ~
@47944 = ~Yes, <PRO_SIRMAAM>! ~
@47945 = ~I'll keep practicing, <PRO_SIRMAAM>! ~
@47946 = ~Greetings, <PRO_SIRMAAM>. ~
@47947 = ~Let's get to it, Private. Attack one of your companions while I evaluate your technique.~
@47948 = ~Yes, <PRO_SIRMAAM>!~
@47949 = ~All right, that's enough. ~
@47950 = ~I think the training dummy fell asleep.~
@47951 = ~Are you fighting or dancing?~
@47952 = ~What do you think, <PRO_SIRMAAM>?~
@47953 = ~You're tentative in your attacks and you move around too much. Try weaving in place instead of skipping. And strike more forcefully.~
@47954 = ~Your style is similar to mine. Let me show you some techniques for getting past an enemy's guard. You can take them by surprise this way...~
@47955 = ~I want you to get in closer to the enemy and stab with more intent. Try that.~
@47956 = ~Your problem is you're not dodging enough. Try getting behind your enemy or spinning in place.~
@47957 = ~If you don't mind, I think I can teach the private some tricks. You've got the right idea, but you're not taking it far enough.~ [BD47957]
@47958 = ~You mean I should try to fight... well, dirtier? What if I kicked low, like this... and feinted off to one side...~
@47959 = ~That's it. Leave the honor to nobles. Fight to win.~ [BD47959]
@47960 = ~I will! Thank you!~
@47961 = ~You mean I should try to fight... well, dirtier? What if I kicked low, like this... and feinted off to one side... ~
@47962 = ~Now you're getting the idea. We don't fight for honor. We fight for our lives. We fight to win.~
@47963 = ~How's this?~
@47964 = ~Much better. Keep practicing and you'll do fine. ~
@47965 = ~Yes, <PRO_SIRMAAM>! ~
@47966 = ~Well... okay, if you say so. ~
@47967 = ~Keep at it, soldier! ~
@47968 = ~Stab... stab... weave!~
@47969 = ~Ready to go, <PRO_SIRMAAM>! Just let me at the enemy! I'll kill them all! ~
@47970 = ~Easy there, Private. Let's see what you've got first. Attack!~
@47971 = ~Yes, <PRO_SIRMAAM>!~
@47972 = ~Yes, <PRO_SIRMAAM>! Er, which recruit should I attack...?~
@47973 = ~It really doesn't matter. Just pick one and hit them.~
@47974 = ~The ugly one.~
@47975 = ~Are you stalling, soldier?~
@47976 = ~Any of them, just hurry up. You're wasting my time.~
@47977 = ~Yes, <PRO_SIRMAAM>!~
@47978 = ~Yes, <PRO_SIRMAAM>! Would you like me to start with my sword or begin at range with my crossbow?~
@47979 = ~Sword.~
@47980 = ~Crossbow.~
@47981 = ~Are you trying to stall, Hester?~
@47982 = ~It doesn't matter. Attack something!~
@47983 = ~Yes, <PRO_SIRMAAM>!~
@47984 = ~Yes, <PRO_SIRMAAM>! ...Uh, my weapon seems to be broken. Maybe you could train one of the other recruits and get back to me?~
@47985 = ~Are you stalling, soldier?~
@47986 = ~Try asking the enemy to come back when you're ready. See how far that gets you.~
@47987 = ~Attack a recruit or I attack you. Which would you prefer?~
@47988 = ~N-no, of course not. ~
@47989 = ~Every fighter gets nervous from time to time. There's no shame in it. I can teach you some tricks to help you focus.~
@47990 = ~You've never been in battle before, have you? ~
@47991 = ~You've never been in battle before, have you? ~
@47992 = ~Viconia, you look like you have something to say?~
@47993 = ~M'Khiin? You look like you've something to say.~
@47994 = ~Every soldier has to fight their nerves from time to time. You have to ignore everything around you and concentrate on why you're here.~
@47995 = ~If you're frightened of combat, imagine dying in as much gory detail as you can. Once you accept the idea, you'll stop fearing it.~
@47996 = ~Yes, <PRO_SIRMAAM>. Sorry, <PRO_SIRMAAM>. ~
@47997 = ~Every fighter gets nervous from time to time. There's no shame in it. I can teach you some tricks to help you focus.~

@48003 = ~If you're frightened of combat, imagine dying in as much gory detail as you can. Once you accept the idea, you'll stop fearing it.~
@48004 = ~Everyone fears death, young one. It's the natural state of mortals. Shar teaches that it's foolish to chase hope or plan overmuch for the future. Death comes to all of us in the end. It's what we do in the moment that matters.~ [BD48004]
@48005 = ~Shar teaches that it's foolish to chase hope or plan overmuch for the future. Death comes to us all in the end. It's what we do in the moment that matters.~
@48006 = ~So by trying to avoid battle and all that comes with it, I'm missing out on my life now...?~
@48007 = ~Life is loss. In the end, we lose our lives. Accept that truth and move forward.~ [BD48007]
@48008 = ~I... I'll try.~
@48009 = ~I think I understand. If I focus on why we're here, the injustices Caelar's wrought upon the Sword Coast, maybe I can ignore my nerves.~
@48010 = ~That's the spirit. Keep practicing and focus on the cause, not your fears.~
@48011 = ~I suppose I could try that. If I can't stop thinking these dark thoughts, I might as well embrace them. Thank you, <PRO_SIRMAAM>.~
@48012 = ~Thank you, <PRO_SIRMAAM>. I feel calmer already.~
@48013 = ~No, <PRO_SIRMAAM>, I haven't. I keep thinking about what might happen, if I'll get hurt or let my team down...~
@48014 = ~Every soldier has those fears. You're here because you feel a duty to serve, though, not because it's a safe or easy path. Remember that. ~
@48015 = ~I think I understand. By concentrating on the importance of my duty, maybe I can forget about my nerves. ~
@48016 = ~That's the spirit. Keep practicing and focus on the cause, not your fears.~
@48017 = ~Pain hurts, but it makes you stronger. Fear death and you'll never really live.~ [BD48017]
@48018 = ~But life doesn't end at death. I can pull back the veil and speak to the spirits of my kin from time to time. Do the best you can in life, but don't fear death.~
@48019 = ~I'm a faithful worshipper, and I'm not afraid of vanishing after death. But... it's nice to know the living will still be able to reach me.~
@48020 = ~I feel much better, <PRO_SIRMAAM>! ~
@48021 = ~G-g-good day, <PRO_SIRMAAM>. ~
@48022 = ~You seem nervous, soldier. Let's fix that right now, then. Attack a fellow recruit and show me what you've got!~
@48023 = ~Maybe a l-little bit. I don't have much combat experience. ~
@48024 = ~Let's fix that right now, then. Attack that training dummy and show me what you've got! ~
@48025 = ~Yes, <PRO_SIRMAAM>! ~
@48026 = ~Yes, <PRO_SIRMAAM>!~
@48027 = ~All right, that's enough for now.~
@48028 = ~Why don't you try a slash next? Then maybe a jab?~
@48029 = ~Is that all you know how to do?~
@48030 = ~Well, <PRO_SIRMAAM>? How did I do?~
@48031 = ~You've got the basic forms, but you're repetitive. As you get more skilled, you'll get more creative, but for now, remember: Vary your attack patterns.~
@48032 = ~You obviously have a knack for memorizing attack patterns. Have you always found it easy to learn and memorize?~
@48033 = ~Dynaheir, have you anything to say to Garrold, here?~
@48034 = ~Edwin, can you offer Garrold any advice?~
@48035 = ~You're obviously good at memorizing patterns. Come up with a few variant attack forms and cycle through them on the battlefield.~
@48036 = ~Your form is good, but you need to hit harder and faster. Try moving through your attack pattern as quickly as possible, over and over again!~
@48037 = ~I'll try to remember that, <PRO_SIRMAAM>. Thank you!~
@48038 = ~This young man seems more intelligent than most. Allow me to look at thine aura, soldier... I see much potential in thy abilities. Perhaps thou shouldst train with magic instead of steel.~ [BD48038]
@48039 = ~I see much potential in thine abilities, young man. Perhaps thous't should train with the battle mages instead of with steel.~
@48040 = ~I've always liked to study but never considered wizardry... Thank you! I'll visit the mages at once.~
@48041 = ~Yes. I wanted to continue my schooling but when the call went out for militia, I knew my duty was to serve.~
@48042 = ~I sense magical potential in you, similar to my own. You are wasted as a soldier—train with the battle mages instead.~
@48043 = ~I'm glad you think my routine is solid. I'll work on my speed.~
@48044 = ~It's obvious this weakling is no soldier. I've eaten chickens with thicker legs than his. He seems moderately intelligent, though. Get him into mage training. He may be of use some day.~
@48045 = ~He seems moderately intelligent, though. Get him away from these sword-swinging lunkheads and into a mage unit. He might do less harm there.~
@48046 = ~Good <DAYNIGHTALL>, <PRO_SIRMAAM>.~
@48047 = ~All right, soldier, enough small talk. Take on one of your fellow recruits and I'll advise you on your technique.~
@48048 = ~Right away.~
@48049 = ~Slash slash jab, slash parry. How am I doing?~
@48050 = ~Decent, if unenthusiastic.~
@48051 = ~You're supposed to pretend it's alive, not pretend you're stabbing a corpse.~
@48052 = ~You'll be dead in the first charge with that lackluster attitude.~
@48053 = ~How am I doing, <PRO_SIRMAAM>?~
@48054 = ~You're not here to impress me, you're here to survive and protect the land. Let's spar so you can practice on a skilled opponent.~
@48055 = ~Let's spar. It should be interesting to practice with another half-elf.~
@48056 = ~Corwin, any thoughts?~
@48057 = ~What do you think, Jaheira?~
@48058 = ~You need more attention, more energy. You're fighting for your life as well as Daggerford.~
@48059 = ~Your low energy might work to your advantage. Stare intently at your enemies while attacking. You might confuse them and break their morale.~
@48060 = ~Thank you, <PRO_SIRMAAM>.~
@48061 = ~That helped, thank you. There aren't many of our kind here. It's hard to feel part of the team when I'm so obviously different.~
@48062 = ~Everyone has something that makes them different. Think instead on what you have in common: a desire to protect the land.~
@48063 = ~It's hard to feel part of the team when I'm so obviously different.~
@48064 = ~Everyone has something that makes them different. Think instead on what you have in common; a desire to protect the land. ~
@48065 = ~You're right. We all care about our duty. I'll try to be more a part of the team from now on.~
@48066 = ~Yes. When I first joined the militia, I was the only half-elf in my unit. I already felt "between races," so being the only half-elf made me feel more alienated.~
@48067 = ~I admit I've felt somewhat alienated. It's hard to feel part of the team when I'm so obviously different.~
@48068 = ~What helped me was remembering that we were all there for the same reason: to serve the land and protect its people.~
@48069 = ~I have never been a soldier, but I know what it is to be different. I was raised by druids, not by my parents, and often felt alone.~
@48070 = ~I admit I've felt somewhat alienated. It's hard to feel part of the team when I'm so obviously different.~
@48071 = ~Everyone has a reason to feel alone. We each make our own paths and fight for our own causes. You must find the strength within to endure, as do we all.~
@48072 = ~That's... unusual advice. I'll think about what you've said.~
@48073 = ~Good <DAYNIGHTALL>.~
@48074 = ~Let's get to it! Ready to go, <PRO_SIRMAAM>! ~
@48075 = ~That's the attitude I like to see, soldier. Show that recruit over there what you've got.~
@48076 = ~You got it! For Daggerford! ~
@48077 = ~Two stabs in the thighs, one in the stomach, and wait for him to fall! How was that, <PRO_SIRMAAM>? ~
@48078 = ~Not bad, but you're striking heavily armored areas. Aim for the joints. You'll conserve energy and do more damage.~
@48079 = ~You're doing the same thing I did when I first learned to fight. Going for the areas you can reach. Let me show you a different method.~
@48080 = ~What do you think, M'Khiin?~
@48081 = ~Glint, it looks like there's something on your mind.~
@48082 = ~You'll wear yourself out hitting those armor plates over and over. Look for injured enemies to finish off, or challenge combatants of your size.~
@48083 = ~You need to find a way to make your height work for you. Aim for ankles and knees. Bring them down to your level.~
@48084 = ~Don't try to fight like a big one. Hitting up wears you out.~ [BD48084]
@48085 = ~I do tire pretty quickly during drills. I thought I just needed more training.~
@48086 = ~Learn to fight right today. Less to unlearn later.~ [BD48086]
@48087 = ~That makes a lot of sense. I'll start practicing right away!~
@48088 = ~I do get fatigued pretty quickly during drills. I thought I needed more training.~
@48089 = ~Striking upward wears you out and doesn't do much damage. Try to hit between the joints of armor, or look for lightly armored opponents. ~
@48090 = ~Sure, I can try that. I'll get to practicing, <PRO_SIRMAAM>.~
@48091 = ~You want to stab at the enemy's torso. A natural instinct, I understand it—but it's not as effective as it could be, and I'm guessing it's hard on the arms, right?~ [BD48091]
@48092 = ~It's natural to stab at the enemy's torso, but it's hard on the arms and not very effective.~
@48093 = ~I do get fatigued pretty quickly during drills. I thought I needed more training.~
@48094 = ~Nah. Fight smarter, not harder. I say aim for the kneecaps.~ [BD48094]
@48095 = ~I think I'm getting the hang of this! ~
@48096 = ~Finished training those recruits yet? ~
@48097 = ~I'll do my best to whip them into shape.~
@48098 = ~I've finished training the recruits.~
@48099 = ~Then get to it! ~
@48100 = ~Let's see how you did.~
@48101 = ~Incredible! I didn't think it was possible to whip that ragtag unit into shape, but you've done it.~ [BD48101]
@48102 = ~It took some time and patience, but I'm happy with the result.~
@48103 = ~I did, didn't I?~
@48104 = ~It wasn't easy. I deserve compensation.~
@48105 = ~These louts might actually have my back in battle thanks to you. Here, take this. I don't need it and you might. ~ [BD48105]
@48106 = ~Thank you.~
@48107 = ~Magic items are handy things to have. Thanks.~
@48108 = ~This should suffice.~
@48109 = ~If you ever need anything from me or these soldiers, just ask.~
@48110 = ~They're better than they were, I'll give you that. Not amazing, but better.~ [BD48110]
@48111 = ~It took some time and patience to get them even to this level.~
@48112 = ~There's limits to what even I can do in a few hours.~
@48113 = ~It was no easy task. ~
@48114 = ~I appreciate you trying, anyway. Who knows, you might have saved a couple of their lives. Here, take this armor. It doesn't fit any of the recruits and it might keep you alive.~ [BD48114]
@48115 = ~I appreciate it.~
@48116 = ~Given the level of incompetence I was dealing with, your soldiers might need it more than I do, ill-fitting or not—but I'll still take it. Thanks.~
@48117 = ~If this is the best you can give me, it'll have to do.~
@48118 = ~Dismissed.~
@48119 = ~What—? How is this even possible? I think—they might even be WORSE than when I left!~ [BD48119]
@48120 = ~I did the best I could with them.~
@48121 = ~I don't think you appreciate how hard I worked!~
@48122 = ~No one could help these incompetents.~
@48123 = ~You think this is a joke? You'd gamble with my and my soldiers' lives?~ [BD48123]
@48124 = ~That's for wasting my time! Soldiers, keep practicing. I'll try to undo all the damage this twit has done to you!~ [BD48124]
@48125 = ~Gosh, I think you might have made her angry.~
@48126 = ~Ahh! I'm burning up!~
@48127 = ~The pain... I can't take it anymore!~
@48128 = ~If I die, tell my children I'll watch over them.~
@48129 = ~Water, please... Water...~
@48130 = ~Just let me die. I'm ready.~
@48131 = ~I'm sorry, I can't talk right now. There are many I must tend to.~
@48132 = ~My name is <CHARNAME>. Is there any way I can help you here?~
@48133 = ~You can make time for the hero of Baldur's Gate, I'm sure.~
@48134 = ~Make time. You'll not like the alternative. What's your name?~
@48135 = ~Well, I'm not sure. Who are you? ~
@48136 = ~I'm <CHARNAME>. I'm looking for ways to help the coalition.~
@48137 = ~They call me the hero of Baldur's Gate. Maybe you've heard of me.~
@48138 = ~<CHARNAME>, and I don't have time to waste answering your questions.~
@48139 = ~The hero of Baldur's Gate? It's an honor. I've heard many stories about you.~
@48140 = ~Who are you, exactly?~
@48141 = ~What's going on here?~
@48142 = ~Is there anything I can do to help?~
@48143 = ~I am Theodosia Immartyred, but call me Dosia—everyone else does. I'm a cleric of Ilmater with the unenviable task of running this triage camp.~
@48144 = ~Ilmater, you say?~
@48145 = ~Why do we need a triage camp? The fighting hasn't started yet.~
@48146 = ~Is there anything I can do to help?~
@48147 = ~A sickness has broken out in camp and several soldiers have fallen ill. We keep healing the soldiers and they keep getting worse. ~
@48148 = ~How can I be of service?~
@48149 = ~I'm no expert but maybe if they keep getting worse it means you're not really healing them.~
@48150 = ~Why should I care?~
@48151 = ~A deity of suffering and penance—some call him the Crying God. I took my vows as a young girl to serve him all my life.~
@48152 = ~What needs to be done here?~
@48153 = ~How wonderful for you. What exactly is going on here?~
@48154 = ~Your faith doesn't interest me as much as what happened to these people.~
@48155 = ~The illness is complicated and resists all our efforts to understand it. If we can't find a cure for these people, it could compromise our entire force.~
@48156 = ~Have you any knowledge of healing? Or companions that might? Examine our patients. Perhaps you'll discover something I cannot.~
@48157 = ~I'll look at the patients and return to you shortly.~
@48158 = ~I'll look at them—from a distance. I don't want to get sick.~
@48159 = ~If I do, I'll expect to be rewarded for it.~
@48160 = ~I can ask nothing more. Come back once you've taken a look at the afllicted.~
@48161 = ~Ugggh... ~
@48162 = ~Ugggh... so hot. Feel like I'm in the Calim Desert... ~
@48163 = ~Keep still. I'm here to help. I'm just going to take a look at you, all right?~
@48164 = ~Try to relax. Viconia here is going to take a look at you.~
@48165 = ~Glint here is going to try and help you with that.~
@48166 = ~Keep still, soldier. I'm going to have Jaheira take a look at you.~
@48167 = ~Ugggh... ~
@48168 = ~You're burning up. We need to find a way to bring this fever down immediately. ~
@48169 = ~I am to nurse surface-dwellers now? Fine. If I must.~ [BD48169]
@48170 = ~How do we do that? ~
@48171 = ~The man is burning up. Ordinary methods will do little against a fever this strong. I know of a salve I can make that might reduce the heat.~ [BD48171]
@48172 = ~Good job, Viconia. ~
@48173 = ~Whoa! The man's hotter than a fire mephit's libido! We need to bring the heat down. I know a couple herbs that will do the trick. I'll get started on a poultice right away.~ [BD48173]
@48174 = ~What should we do? ~
@48175 = ~Bring the heat down, of course! I know a couple herbs that will do the trick. Make a poultice and apply it to the sick. ~
@48176 = ~Great, thanks Glint. ~
@48177 = ~This man is grievously ill. His skin's hot enough to light parchment. I know healing herbs that can bring the fever down. I'll begin work on a poultice immediately.~
@48178 = ~What do you suggest, Jaheira? ~
@48179 = ~I know healing herbs that can bring the fever down. I'll start making a poultice for the sick right away. ~
@48180 = ~Thank you. ~
@48181 = ~Gods, help me... Ugggh...~
@48182 = ~Keep strong, soldier. I'll find a cure for this.~
@48183 = ~I'll keep looking into this. Don't go anywhere, all right?~
@48184 = ~Enough whining. Others are worse off than you.~
@48185 = ~Aaah... AAAH! ~
@48186 = ~Aaah... AAAH! So much... pain. Everything HURTS... NYAAGH!~
@48187 = ~Easy. I'm here to help. Let's take a look at you.~
@48188 = ~Try to stay still so Viconia can take a look at you.~
@48189 = ~We're here to help. Glint's going to a look at you, all right?~
@48190 = ~Jaheira, what do you make of this?~
@48191 = ~Easy, easy. I'm going to have Corwin take a look at you.~
@48192 = ~Minsc, it looks like you have something to say.~
@48193 = ~Moan... ~
@48194 = ~I can tell you're in pain, but you're also agitated. I need you to calm down. Slow, deep breaths. ~
@48195 = ~This man is in obvious pain, but he's also agitated. He's wasting energy flailing about. ~
@48196 = ~What do you suggest? ~
@48197 = ~This man is in obvious pain, but he's also agitated. He's wasting energy flailing about. We need to get him to calm down. Relax, human. We're going to... wait. Stop! He's lost control!~ [BD48197]
@48198 = ~Plenty, as always. The pain is driving him mad. I've seen this happen to rats before. They turn aggressive at the slightest—look out! ~
@48199 = ~What do you suggest? ~
@48200 = ~Let's see here, shall we? Pain and tenderness, yes, yes. Calm down, my good sir, calm down! You need to conserve your energy. You... aah! Get back, he's got a weapon!~ [BD48200]
@48201 = ~Too much pain, too restless. Get ready to fight.~ [BD48201]
@48202 = ~What do you mean by that? ~
@48203 = ~Restless energy lives in this man's limbs, despite his pain. The agony seems to ignite rage in his mind. I've seen this before, in rats from the Forest of Wyrms. We need to be careful or he will—too late! Watch out!~
@48204 = ~Soldier? SOLDIER. Can you hear me? Focus on my voice.~
@48205 = ~Any idea what's wrong? ~
@48206 = ~He seems on the verge of snapping. I've seen forest rats turn like this, biting and clawing. Soldier? Stay calm. That's an order!~
@48207 = ~Forest rats do this too, when the pain is too much to bear. Look at his eyes! Minsc knows nothing of sickness, but he knows this man is ready to bash in a few heads! Watch out!~ [BD48207]
@48208 = ~Why do you think that? ~
@48209 = ~I can see it in his eyes! Forest rats do this too, turning feral when they are ill. Watch out! ~
@48210 = ~No—NO!~
@48211 = ~Try to hang on, friend. I'll do everything I can to help you.~
@48212 = ~I'll be back when I know more about this plague. Until then, try to keep the groaning to a minimum.~
@48213 = ~Show some dignity, soldier. Endure your pain in silence.~
@48214 = ~Groan... ~
@48215 = ~I've seen symptoms like this before, in forest rats. When they get sick they turn agitated like this, and shortly after they get vicious. ~
@48216 = ~Aaargh... AAARGH! ~
@48217 = ~Uhh... Please, help me...~
@48218 = ~I'm going to try. Lie still for a moment while I examine you.~
@48219 = ~If you'll stay still long enough for Viconia to examine you, we might be able to do that.~
@48220 = ~That's the plan. Just try to stay still while Glint has a look at you.~
@48221 = ~We're going to try. Lie still for a moment while Jaheira takes a look at you.~
@48222 = ~Feel... so bad... ~
@48223 = ~You seem worse off than the others. You're in the center of the group too. Could that be affecting your condition?~
@48224 = ~Her symptoms are much more advanced. But why...? Ah. Her position in the center of camp. Proximity to others with the illness must make it worse.~ [BD48224]
@48225 = ~What could be causing her poor condition? ~
@48226 = ~I believe her position in the center of camp is putting more strain on her. Proximity to other people with the illness must make it worse. ~
@48227 = ~Thank you, Viconia. ~
@48228 = ~Cloakshadow's cowl, you ARE in bad shape, aren't you? Why would that be...? Oh, yes. Yes, I see. I think her location is making her worse. She's in the center of the group—more exposed to the afflicted than the others.~ [BD48228]
@48229 = ~Why is she worse off than the others? ~
@48230 = ~She's lying in the center of the group, meaning she's more exposed to ill people than any of the others. My guess is her location is making her worse. ~
@48231 = ~Thanks, Glint. ~
@48232 = ~She is in poor condition, my friend. If we don't find a cure for this sickness, she will be the first to die. Her position in the camp's center leaves her exposed to all her ill companions. I believe that proximity makes the illness worse.~
@48233 = ~Why is she worse off than the others? ~
@48234 = ~Her position in the center of the camp exposes her to all her ill companions. I think proximity to other sufferers makes the illness worse. ~
@48235 = ~Thank you, Jaheria. ~
@48236 = ~Uhhh... everything's spinning... ~
@48237 = ~Keep still. Try to conserve your energy. With luck, I'll soon have a cure.~
@48238 = ~Usually takes me a few bottles of wine to get to that stage. Hang on and try to enjoy the ride. I'll return soon.~
@48239 = ~No one cares. Lie still and keep quiet.~
@48240 = ~Uhhh... ~
@48241 = ~Please examine the patients we have here. Perhaps you can help us cure this illness.~
@48242 = ~I'll get back to examining those patients.~
@48243 = ~I've finished examining all the patients.~
@48244 = ~I poked and prodded everyone I could find. If I caught anything, there'll be hells to pay.~
@48245 = ~I'm finished with the patients.~
@48246 = ~Let's talk another time.~
@48247 = ~What did you learn?~
@48248 = ~The afflicted are running high fevers, becoming violent, and becoming sicker when they are in close proximity to one another. Give them herbal salves to reduce their fever, bind them to their cots and move them farther apart.~
@48249 = ~The afflicted are running high fevers and becoming violent. Give them herbal salves to reduce their fever and bind them to their cots.~
@48250 = ~The afflicted are running high fevers and becoming sicker when they are in close proximity to one another. Give them herbal salves to reduce their fever and move them farther apart.~
@48251 = ~Nothing you don't already know.~
@48252 = ~That will help a great deal. I'll make good use of this information immediately. Ilmater bless you for your aid.~
@48253 = ~The patients are becoming agitated, even violent. One attacked me. We should bind them to their cots.~
@48254 = ~Patients in close proximity to others are faring worse. We should space the cots more widely.~
@48255 = ~That's not enough? What more do you want from me?~
@48256 = ~A grim situation, that. We'll do as you say.~
@48257 = ~Also, the patients all have an unusually high fever. I believe that can be helped with an herbal poultice.~
@48258 = ~You should also space the cots more widely. Close proximity to others afflicted worsen the symptoms.~
@48259 = ~I would if I were you.~
@48260 = ~You have a healer's eye. We'll move the bedding further apart immediately. What else have you learned?~
@48261 = ~I learned that the patients all have an unusually high fever. We can bring the fever down with an herbal poultice.~
@48262 = ~The patients are becoming agitated, even violent. One attacked me. We should bind them to their cots.~
@48263 = ~Nothing you don't know already.~
@48264 = ~Do you have any ideas on where to go from here? ~
@48265 = ~The patients' symptoms resemble those of sickly rats. There are several rats around camp, so I'll try to catch one and see if I can learn anything from it.~
@48266 = ~The patients' symptoms resemble those of sickly rats from the Forest of Wyrms. I'll try to catch one and let Minsc take a look at it.~
@48267 = ~The symptoms are similar to those of sickly rats in the Forest of Wyrms. I'll try to catch one. Jaheira might be able to learn something from it.~
@48268 = ~The patients' symptoms resemble those of sickly rats from the Forest of Wyrms. I'll try to catch one and see if Corwin can learn anything from it.~
@48269 = ~I know something of the healing arts. I believe the blackthorn tree might have the qualities needed to concoct a cure. I'll seek one in the woods.~
@48270 = ~None. Viconia, have you any thoughts?~
@48271 = ~Glint? What do you think?~
@48272 = ~Jaheira? Do you think we can create a cure?~
@48273 = ~I was going to ask you the same, Dosia.~
@48274 = ~I think all we can do is let the illness ride its course. Keep the sick from the healthy, and hope for the best.~
@48275 = ~We can't risk infecting the entire camp. The most merciful thing to do is to execute these people and burn the bodies.~
@48276 = ~Boo will help translate his rat-cousins' speech!~ [BD48276]
@48277 = ~A solid place to start. A druid or ranger might be able to learn something from examining a rat. There are plenty around camp.~
@48278 = ~You want me to interview a rat? Very well, I'll help however I can.~
@48279 = ~The bark of the blackthorn tree might be used to brew a cure—if we can find one soon enough for it to make a difference.~ [BD48279]
@48280 = ~I once helped a town suffering a similar plight with a blackthorn bark brew. If we can find one in the forest, I might be able to do it again.~ [BD48280]
@48281 = ~The bark of the blackthorn tree that grows in these parts has many healing properties. I suggest we venture into the woods to find one.~
@48282 = ~The only idea I've got is a long shot. There's tell of a druid who lives in the woods, Onoroth. Supposedly he knows much of herbs, and healing in general. If we can find him, he might be able to help.~
@48283 = ~You think he might know a cure?~
@48284 = ~I've never found reclusive hermits to be that reliable a resource, as a matter of course.~
@48285 = ~The only idea I've got is a long shot. There's tell of a druid who lives in the woods, Onoroth. Supposedly he knows much of herbs, and healing in general. If we can find him, he might be able to help.~
@48286 = ~I'll start out at once.~
@48287 = ~Long shots sometimes pay off. I'll find the druid.~
@48288 = ~I'll find this hermit and force him to help us.~
@48289 = ~It's not much of a plan, but I've got nothing better. Please hurry. I fear we haven't much time left.~
@48290 = ~That's unacceptable. Maybe we can't help these people right now, but we shouldn't stop looking for a cure.~
@48291 = ~We won't. They yet live, and where there's life, there's hope. Do you have any ideas where I might start?~
@48292 = ~The fate of the Sword Coast hangs in the balance. We can't lose sight of that. Keep the sick away from the rest of camp and let the illness run its course.~
@48293 = ~The strong will survive. We're better off without the weak.~
@48294 = ~You might think that's best, but I'll continue seeking a cure. Now leave me.~
@48295 = ~At last, a sensible solution.~
@48296 = ~What?! No, no. Unacceptable. You can't be serious.~
@48297 = ~I don't like it, either. Let me think a moment...~
@48298 = ~The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few, Dosia. We can't shy away from what must be done.~
@48299 = ~Do I look like I'm joking? Our enemies wouldn't hesitate to take such action, nor can we if we're to win this fight.~
@48300 = ~I thought you a hero. You're naught but a monster. If you'll not help here, begone. I've work to do.~
@48301 = ~No! No. I can't accept that.~
@48302 = ~I don't want to accept it either, but I see few other options.~
@48303 = ~Being a good leader means making difficult choices. We must do what's best for the camp.~
@48304 = ~Your moral code has no place here. We must do whatever it takes, make whatever sacrifices are necessary, to achieve victory.~
@48305 = ~I'll pass what you've said on to the General. But I don't like it.~
@48306 = ~Ilmater's blessing be upon you. Fare thee well.~
@48307 = ~Squeak!~
@48308 = ~Hello, little rat. I'd like to talk to you about an illness in our camp.~
@48309 = ~Uh, hi, rat. This might seem weird, but I wonder if you would talk to my friend here?~
@48310 = ~I can't understand you. I'd better come back with a ranger or druid who can translate for me.~
@48311 = ~SQUEEEAK!~
@48312 = ~Hsss! Leave 'em alone! They be my pack!~
@48313 = ~I don't want to interfere with your pack. I just need some information.~
@48314 = ~Where did YOU come from?~
@48315 = ~A wererat! Kill it!~
@48316 = ~This be my territory afore you moved in! Hsss! Leave my pack and go! ~
@48317 = ~I only need to speak to one rat. Then I'll be on my way.~
@48318 = ~Well, it's our territory now. And as ridiculous as it sounds, I need to talk to a rat. ~
@48319 = ~Crossing me is a mistake you don't want to make, you malodorous brute. I've slain far worse than you in my time.~
@48320 = ~My nest! My pack! Die! ~
@48321 = ~Hello, little rat. I'd like to talk to you about an illness in our camp.~
@48322 = ~Uh, hi, rat. This might seem weird, but I wonder if you would talk to my friend here?~
@48323 = ~I can't understand you. I'd better come back with a ranger or druid who can translate for me.~
@48324 = ~Squeakum squeak. ~
@48325 = ~Some of our people are sick. They get a bad fever and then they get violent before they die. I know this happens to your kind too. ~
@48326 = ~Squeak squeakin'. ~
@48327 = ~You roll in the bark of the blackthorn tree when you get ill? ~
@48328 = ~Squeak! Squeak.~
@48329 = ~Oh, the MOLDY bark of the blackthorn tree. And they grow in the forest around the camp. Thank you, little rat. ~
@48330 = ~Squeak. ~
@48331 = ~Corwin, can you talk to the rat?~
@48332 = ~Jaheira, can you talk to the rat?~
@48333 = ~Minsc, can you talk to the rat?~
@48334 = ~I never imagined that talking with rats would be a critical part of my role in the war. Good think I didn't go into fortunetelling as a career.~
@48335 = ~I'm describing the illness to the rat and asking about its pack's experience...~
@48336 = ~Squeak squeakin'.~
@48337 = ~It says when its kind gets sick, they roll in the moldy bark of the blackthorn tree.~
@48338 = ~Can we find those in the forest outside the camp? ~
@48339 = ~Yes, we can! If we can find some of this moldy bark, maybe we can cure the soldiers.~
@48340 = ~I shall do what I can. I have seen rats with symptoms like those afflicted in camp before—I'm asking the creature what it does when its pack falls ill.~
@48341 = ~I have seen rats with these symptoms before. I'm asking the creature what it does when its pack falls ill.~
@48342 = ~Squeak squeakin'.~
@48343 = ~In the forest grows a tree we call the blackthorn tree. Old trees collapse and grow mold on their bark—the rats roll in it to relieve the sickness. We must find a tree and collect all the mold we can—but leave some for the rats.~
@48344 = ~Do the rats eat the mold to get better? ~
@48345 = ~No, they roll in it. We must venture into the woods. Once we find a tree, we should collect all the mold we can. But leave some for the rats.~
@48346 = ~Nay, but Boo can! Speak to your cousins, Boo! Tell them of the sickly soldiers and ask if they know what to do.~ [BD48346]
@48347 = ~Of course he can. ~
@48348 = ~Speak to your cousins, Boo! Tell them of the sickly soldiers and ask if they know what to do.~
@48349 = ~Squeak squeakin'.~
@48350 = ~Boo tells me of a tree in the woods around camp. It grows black thorns on its bark and mold grows on the fallen trunks.~ [BD48350]
@48351 = ~When the forest rats sicken, Boo says they roll around in this mold. We must find the tree and its soggy bark to heal the sick ones!~ [BD48351]
@48352 = ~What do you want? Get out of here! ~
@48353 = ~I'm looking for a druid who knows about healing. Several soldiers are ill. Their sickness threatens our whole camp.~
@48354 = ~I've returned with the basilisk claw.~
@48355 = ~Forgive me. I didn't mean to disturb you.~
@48356 = ~Which is it? Tell you what I want or get out of here?~
@48357 = ~Don't threaten me, old man.~
@48358 = ~Go! Now! ~
@48359 = ~You said sickness. Sickness is why you're here? ~
@48360 = ~Yes. Several of our people have developed fever and pain. Some have grown violent.~
@48361 = ~Actually, I need to return later.~
@48362 = ~The forest gives everything, yes. The forest is all. ~
@48363 = ~Do you mean there's a healing plant in the forest?~
@48364 = ~Does it give gold? If so, point me toward the gold tree right away.~
@48365 = ~I've no time for riddles.~
@48366 = ~The forest gives everything, yes. It was mother and father to me, providing all I needed. I used to roam it freely, but now... now I am old, and move so slowly...~
@48367 = ~I'm sorry to hear that. Is there anything I can do to help you?~
@48368 = ~You seem pretty spry to me. Why don't you tell me what you know about this illness and I'll leave you to your frolicking?~
@48369 = ~And your point is...?~
@48370 = ~Knowledge... my knowledge is precious. Years of living alone, studying, meditating. Why should I share what I have learned with you?~
@48371 = ~I'm <CHARNAME>. Some call me hero. I'm just trying to do some good in this world. I believe you have information that can save lives.~
@48372 = ~If you don't help me, we might lose the fight to the crusade. Zealot hordes will overrun your forest. Do you want that?~
@48373 = ~Let me answer your question with a question: Why should I not slay you where you stand?~
@48374 = ~Good and evil mean nothing to me—but you are determined, I can see. Determination is often needed to bring balance to the world.~
@48375 = ~You argue well. The forest doesn't care about war, but I care about the forest.~
@48376 = ~Someday my bones will sink into the soil and I will repay the forest that gave me so much. But that day has not come yet.~
@48377 = ~I don't trust you, outsider. You come to my forest asking so much, so I will ask something of YOU.~
@48378 = ~Fair enough. What do you want of me?~
@48379 = ~Well, there's a shocking plot twist. All right, let's hear it. What do you need?~
@48380 = ~Tell me what you want, then, but do it quickly. My patience is wearing thin.~
@48381 = ~A basilisk living to the northwest has been driven mad by disease. Slay the beast—give her peace. Then bring me her claw.~
@48382 = ~I'll return when I have her claw.~
@48383 = ~Bloodthirsty basilisk? I can manage that. I'll be back within the hour.~
@48384 = ~It will be done—but the knowledge I receive had better be worth the effort.~
@48385 = ~You are a true friend to the forest. I will help you.~
@48386 = ~Take this healing draught I brewed from the moldy bark of the blackthorn tree. It will cure your sick. Now go. I need stillness again, and the peace of the woods.~
@48387 = ~You've helped bolster our forces. Thank you.~
@48388 = ~Thanks. You can go back to chatting with the trees now.~
@48389 = ~Give it here.~
@48390 = ~Now go! I need stillness again, and the peace of the woods. ~
@48391 = ~I'm very busy with the triage camp. Excuse me.~
@48392 = ~I'd stop and talk if I could, but I'm very busy. Excuse me.~
@48393 = ~You've returned! Any news?~
@48394 = ~I've found something I believe will help cure the patients. It's this blackthorn bark.~
@48395 = ~I might have found a cure in this blackthorn bark. Acquiring it was a lot of trouble and effort. How much will you give me for it?~
@48396 = ~Not yet. I'll return as soon as I have something for you.~
@48397 = ~Compensation? I don't understand. ~
@48398 = ~It's simple. I went to a lot of trouble and effort to acquire this cure. What will you pay me for it?~
@48399 = ~Gold, magic items, I don't care as long as you give me something for the cure.~
@48400 = ~I was just teasing you. Here, take the cure.~
@48401 = ~There are few things more distasteful than extorting the sick.~ [BD48401]
@48402 = ~Do not think of them as sick, but as motivated buyers. Only a fool would pass up such an opportunity for profit.~
@48403 = ~You demand payment for saving lives? What kind of hero are you?~
@48404 = ~A practical one. I only want to be paid fairly for my efforts.~
@48405 = ~I never claimed to be a hero. If you want the cure, pay me. If not, I'll smash it on the ground.~
@48406 = ~A poor one indeed, if I let the sick die. Here, take the cure.~
@48407 = ~I serve Ilmater, not Waukeen. I have a few healing potions I could give you, although our soldiers need them more.~
@48408 = ~It will do. Hand them over.~
@48409 = ~Not good enough. I'll hold on to the cure until I find a better offer.~
@48410 = ~I'll not see allies deprived on my account. Here, take the cure.~
@48411 = ~You drive a hard bargain. Here's your reward, "hero."~
@48412 = ~You sicken me. Get out of my camp.~
@48413 = ~Thank Ilmater! Your reputation is well earned, and I'll tell anyone who asks that you're a true hero. I'll administer the cure immediately. Here, take this with my thanks. It's the least I can do.~
@48414 = ~Hurry back.~
@48415 = ~I'll keep on practicing, <PRO_SIRMAAM>!~
@48416 = ~And?~
@48417 = ~Follower of Sarevok~
@48418 = ~Flaming Fist Officer~
@48419 = ~Take this gold, and my thanks. May whatever gods you hold dear watch over you on your travels.~
@48420 = ~Thank you. Good luck on your travels as well.~
@48421 = ~I never say no to gold.~
@48422 = ~It's not much, but I suppose it will have to suffice.~
