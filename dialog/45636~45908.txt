@45638 = ~Stand down!~
@45639 = ~Stand down or we'll put you down!~
@45640 = ~Never! I'll not be imprisoned again!~
@45641 = ~You! You are the one who delivered me to this hell!~ [BD45641]
@45642 = ~Your own crimes brought you to this, Korlasz. You conspired with Sarevok against the city. You must be punished for that.~
@45643 = ~Hell? Your last residence was a crypt. The ducal palace looks like a step up to me.~
@45644 = ~I will deliver you to far worse in short order.~
@45645 = ~As you will be punished for Sarevok's murder!~ [BD45645]
@45646 = ~I was surprised when I was taken to the palace and not to the jail. Now I know it was so the dukes could torment me in private. Did you think I'd be treated fairly? Justly? I expected no mercy but even I didn't expect this... this horror.~ [BD45646]
@45647 = ~You're nothing more than I expected, <CHARNAME>. Pathetic. Now let us finish this!~ [BD45647]
@45648 = ~I see now why they call you "hero." We are in your debt, <PRO_SIRMAAM>.~
@45649 = ~It was nothing. But tell me, who was that?~
@45650 = ~What in the Nine Hells happened here?~
@45651 = ~Did she have help? Or was she working alone?~
@45652 = ~Go report what happened to your superiors.~
@45653 = ~See that you don't forget it.~
@45654 = ~Korlasz—a lieutenant of Sarevok captured shortly after his death and the Iron Throne's fall. I thought you had a hand in her apprehension—perhaps I am mistaken.~
@45655 = ~We thought she was secured. Her manacles were warded, her cell reinforced, but somehow she found the magical power needed to escape.~
@45656 = ~Desperation is a powerful motivator.~
@45657 = ~Best go and let your commanding officer know what's happened here.~
@45658 = ~My thanks. I'd never have deduced she escaped had you not told me as much.~
@45659 = ~I suppose we'll have to. Damn! Captain Emesi won't be happy about this...~
@45660 = ~There's no call for insults.~
@45661 = ~Forgive me, friend. It's been a trying time. Go now, tell your commanding officer what happened here.~
@45662 = ~Are you sure? I just saved you from a prisoner who escaped on your watch. I think there's some call for insults.~
@45663 = ~Your opinion on the matter means little to me. Begone.~
@45664 = ~As you wish. Come on, Royo. Let's go tell Captain Emesi what's happened here.~
@45665 = ~You're right about that. Well, I guess we'd best tell Captain Emesi what happened here. She won't be pleased.~
@45666 = ~I suppose we should go tell Captain Emesi what's happened here. Damn! She'll not be happy with this.~
@45667 = ~It was just her, far as I can tell. The doppelganger's the only other prisoner down here right now. Its cell is still locked and it had no way to communicate with Korlasz.~
@45668 = ~Let me out! Let me out of here, damn it!~
@45669 = ~You aren't out of it yet, friend. ~
@45670 = ~Who are you?~
@45671 = ~You wear the livery of the Flaming Fist. What in the hells happened to you?~
@45672 = ~Nor will you, if you fail to answer my questions.~
@45673 = ~My name is Idianeali. I'm an officer with the Flaming Fist. I stumbled upon a mage in Sarevok's service—she tricked me, locking me in the cell.~
@45674 = ~How did she manage that?~
@45675 = ~I've had dealings with Korlasz before. They're not memories I treasure. Well, don't let me keep you.~
@45676 = ~Why didn't the other guards tell me this?~
@45677 = ~The other guards didn't mention you. And they did mention a doppelganger...~
@45678 = ~Really? She tricked you? She always struck me as more brick and less icepick, if you catch my meaning.~
@45679 = ~Would you be terribly offended if I used my True Sight upon you? These are dangerous times, and I'm leery of taking any chances.~
@45680 = ~She is more clever than I thought—or you are stupid indeed.~
@45681 = ~There's no time for that—we need to stop her!~
@45682 = ~She's been taken care of. You needn't worry on that count.~
@45683 = ~No, we don't. She's dead. Calm yourself.~
@45684 = ~I have stopped her. I'll do the same to you, if you don't calm down.~
@45685 = ~It happened before they arrived. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'll go report to my commander. I'm in enough trouble as it is without adding to it chatting with you.~
@45686 = ~Go, and may Tymora go with you.~
@45687 = ~I'm sure your superiors will have no problem with you talking to me. I am the hero of Baldur's Gate, after all.~
@45688 = ~You'll be in a great deal more trouble if you try to leave before I'm done with you.~
@45689 = ~You have my thanks. Farewell.~
@45690 = ~She's dead? Thank you Helm for watching over your servant. I may get through this without losing my job.~
@45691 = ~I can't just stand around here talking. I've got to speak to my commander! You have my gratitude—I'd give you more had I more to give, but I do not. Now I must bid you farewell.~
@45692 = ~They did, eh? A pity—for you.~
@45693 = ~You? You're the one who slew Sarevok? Then pay the price for defying the Iron Throne! DIE!~
@45694 = ~Then pay the price for defying the Iron Throne! DIE!~
@45695 = ~Ah! A pox upon you! I'll see you dead for this!~
@45696 = ~I don't have time to talk.~
@45697 = ~What was your name again?~
@45698 = ~I just wanted to say that it was good to meet you, Idianeelix.~
@45699 = ~You'll have no time for anything else if you don't stop trying to flee this place and face me.~
@45700 = ~I don't have time to talk. My commander is going to have my arse in a sling as it is without me wasting time on you.~
@45701 = ~What was your name again?~
@45702 = ~I won't take much more of it, I promise. Now, Idianeelix, what happened to you? How did this mage trick you into that cell?~
@45703 = ~You'll have no time for anything else if you don't stop trying to flee this place and face me.~
@45704 = ~I told you, my name is Idianori.~
@45705 = ~And you say a mage tricked you into that cell. How did she do that, exactly?~
@45706 = ~Idianori? A few seconds ago you said it was Idianeali.~
@45707 = ~It was good to meet you, Idianori.~
@45708 = ~Your voice wearies me. Begone.~
@45709 = ~Very clever.~
@45710 = ~You have been useful to me, so I shall let you live. But interfere with my escape and I'll not hesitate to slay you.~
@45711 = ~I don't answer to you. Now excuse me, I must be going.~
@45712 = ~And you. Farewell.~
@45713 = ~And you. Now if you'll excuse me...~
@45714 = ~Take care of yourself. These are dangerous times in the city.~
@45715 = ~I would if I could, but you just let me call you Idianeelix. Which is not the name you claimed when we met.~
@45716 = ~You have made your final mistake, deceiver.~
@45717 = ~They usually are. Farewell.~
@45718 = ~It's a long story—longer than I care to get into. Now I must go.~
@45719 = ~Take care of yourself. These are dangerous times in the city.~
@45720 = ~I'd let you go if I could, but I'm afraid you just let me call you Idianeelix. Which is not the name you claimed when we met.~
@45721 = ~You just made your last mistake, deceiver.~
@45722 = ~What—? Oh. I got the name wrong, didn't I? Very clever.~
@45723 = ~Gladly. Fare thee well.~
@45724 = ~Mercy! Mercy, please, I beg you!~
@45725 = ~Back in your cell, creature.~
@45726 = ~I'll give you the same mercy you'd have given me, monster.~
@45727 = ~Why do monsters always beg for mercy after I've nearly killed them? Imagine the time we'd save if you just started by surrendering.~
@45728 = ~You think me mad enough to spare such a creature as you?~
@45729 = ~I'd rather rot in a cell than die but is that what YOU truly want? I have much to offer, if you give me my freedom.~
@45730 = ~Why would I want anything but to see a solid oak door 'twixt you and the world?~
@45731 = ~It is.~
@45732 = ~What I truly want is to slay you. I was exercising restraint, but I won't be much longer if you don't do as I say.~
@45733 = ~I have much to offer, if you give me my freedom.~
@45734 = ~Beneath the Iron Throne building I have secreted a cache of weapons and valuables—a veritable fortune, there for the taking. Let me live and all of it is yours.~
@45735 = ~ That's an offer I might find tempting, did it not come from a doppelganger and servant of Sarevok. No, changeling. I'll not be swayed by your lies.~
@45736 = ~Tell me where this fortune is and I will let you go.~
@45737 = ~How veritable a fortune are we talking about here? Also, what does veritable mean, exactly?~
@45738 = ~How veritable a fortune are we talking about here? ~
@45739 = ~Tell me where it is or I'll slay you where you stand.~
@45740 = ~No! Listen to me, please. I have much to offer.~
@45741 = ~It means that the thing named is not false, unreal, or imaginary. In this instance, it means the fortune is a real fortune—I do not exaggerate.~
@45742 = ~More than 1,000 gold, a couple swords of exceedingly high quality, potions of various sorts... all very useful.~
@45743 = ~A tempting offer—but one I cannot accept.~
@45744 = ~You say there items are hidden the Iron Throne basement? Where, exactly?~
@45745 = ~Very useful indeed. All right. Tell me the treasure's location. Once I determine it truly exists, I shall free you.~
@45746 = ~You would have me trust you to let me go AFTER I reveal the treasure's location? No. Meet me in the Iron Throne's basement. There, I will give you what I have.~
@45747 = ~Agreed.~
@45748 = ~Swear you will not betray me and I'll release you.~
@45749 = ~Tell me what I want to know or I will kill you.~
@45750 = ~We will meet again soon.~
@45751 = ~Free me and the treasure will be yours. I swear on my life, I'll not cross you.~
@45752 = ~See that you don't. I've better things to do than hunt an errant doppelganger through the city.~
@45753 = ~You better not.~
@45754 = ~Break your oath and your life is forfeit. Better than you have tried to escape my wrath—all lie dead. Understand?~
@45755 = ~A bargain has been made, I will do everything in my power to see it fulfilled. I shall go now, and await you in the basement of the Iron Throne. Farewell.~
@45756 = ~See, I have done as I promised. But listen: I have much to offer to the person who sets me free.~
@45757 = ~I admire your restraint, if nothing else.~
@45758 = ~Fare thee well, champion of Baldur's Gate.~
@45759 = ~Then I will be dead and you will be no richer for it. If that is truly what you desire, I'm in no position to stop you. But if you would see your pockets filled, you will meet me in the Iron Throne building's basement.~
@45760 = ~What do you want?~
@45761 = ~This treasure you mentioned.~
@45762 = ~Nothing from you, monster.~
@45763 = ~Let me out of this box and it will be yours.~
@45764 = ~You're a vile creature of deception. No right-minded person would ever let you out of there.~
@45765 = ~Swear it. Swear you'll not betray me.~
@45766 = ~You think me a fool?~
@45767 = ~Free me and the treasure will be yours. I swear on my life, I'll not cross you.~
@45768 = ~All right. Get out of there.~
@45769 = ~And I swear, also on your life, that crossing me would be one of the last things you ever do. All right. Go.~
@45770 = ~As you're not leaving your cell, you'll not have a chance to cross me.~
@45771 = ~I will await you in the basement of the Iron Throne headquarters for as long as I'm able. Do not delay in meeting me there.~
@45772 = ~Then begone.~
@45773 = ~If you fail to take this opportunity, then you are a fool.~
@45774 = ~Wrong though it is, it's your choice to make. If you'll not change your mind, then begone.~
@45775 = ~You have come.~
@45776 = ~Nothing ventured, nothing gained.~
@45777 = ~So have you. I'm surprised.~
@45778 = ~I considered the chances of receiving the reward you promise me slim. Had I not come, they would have been nonexistent.~
@45779 = ~I said you would have my treasures if you freed me.~
@45780 = ~And you plan to make good on your promise?~
@45781 = ~You'll forgive me if I suspected you of being less than forthright in your intentions.~
@45782 = ~I thought you were lying.~
@45783 = ~I have no quarrel with you, nor do I wish to start one. I have retrieved the treasure from this room and now I give it to you. Take it and I will take my leave.~
@45784 = ~Our business is done.~
@45785 = ~You are like no other doppelganger I've encountered.~
@45786 = ~And it will remain done, provided we never cross paths again.~
@45787 = ~It will be, once I've put an end to your wretched existence.~
@45788 = ~You may have encountered more of my kind than you know. We are not one in attitude or belief. As with your kind, <PRO_RACE>, we are multitudes, each of us an individual. Bear that in mind should you meet another of my people—or any sentient creature you think is lesser than you.~
@45789 = ~The only monsters are those whose actions are monstrous. Bear that in mind the next time you meet one of my kind—or any sentient creature you think is lesser than you.~
@45790 = ~I did everything I said I would, and this is how I'm repaid? So be it!~
@45791 = ~You'll not see me again, and not recognize me if you do. Farewell, O hero of Baldur's Gate—and take care. I have heard whispers. There are many who would see you dead—or worse.~
@45792 = ~Defend yourself! The monster returns! ~
@45793 = ~What monster? Where?~
@45794 = ~You look a little pale there, friend.~
@45795 = ~Calm yourself.~
@45796 = ~To arms! The monster returns! You'll not defeat us, you foul-breathed oaf!~
@45797 = ~I think you have me confused with someone else, friend. I am hardly a monster. What is your name?~
@45798 = ~Hey! There's no call for insults. I didn't say "hey, look, a dead guy" the moment I saw you.~
@45799 = ~If you attack me, you will suffer.~
@45800 = ~Die a second time, ghost!~
@45801 = ~You will fall beneath our blades, fiend!~ [BD45801]
@45802 = ~This is a mistake. Calm yourself, please. I mean you no harm, I promise you.~
@45803 = ~Snap out of it, spectre! ~
@45804 = ~You seek a second death, ghost? I will be happy to oblige you.~
@45805 = ~M'Khiin, can you talk some sense into these spirits?~
@45806 = ~I am a priest. I speak the spirit tongue. Can you hear the truth of my words?~
@45807 = ~Attack! Kill it! ~
@45808 = ~Please, I beg you—don't make me destroy you!~
@45809 = ~No! Don't kill it! Talk to it! You'll find it's quite a gifted conversationalist if you just give it a chance!~
@45810 = ~Can the dead die again, phantom? Let's find out, shall we?~
@45811 = ~DIE!~
@45812 = ~Hold! The creature speaks, like a living <PRO_RACE>.~
@45813 = ~For good reason, I assure you. Can you understand me now? If so, tell me who you were in life? What brought you to this unfortunate circumstance?~
@45814 = ~Yes! Finally, someone notices. It took you long enough.~
@45815 = ~What is it you spirits want of me?~
@45816 = ~Maybe. Spirit, can you hear me? Talk to me now, if you can.~ [BD45816]
@45817 = ~I hear your voice... you come into view. ~
@45818 = ~Thank you, M'Khiin. Spirit, can you understand me now? Tell me who you were in life.~
@45819 = ~Finally, you speak sense. More or less. Who were you?~
@45820 = ~What do you want from us, spirits?~
@45821 = ~I hear your voice... you come into view. ~
@45822 = ~Spirit, can you understand me now? Tell me who you were in life.~
@45823 = ~Finally, you speak sense. More or less. Who were you?~
@45824 = ~What do you want from us, spirits?~
@45825 = ~Stones fell around us. The screams of the dying filled our ears... We ran, seeking safety.~
@45826 = ~Did a cavern collapse on you?~
@45827 = ~Could you be a little more specific? About any of that?~
@45828 = ~Speak more clearly, spirit.~
@45829 = ~Stones fell around us. The screams of the dying filled our ears... We ran, seeking safety. Wings beat in the air. There was fire—I smelled burning flesh. A stone cut me as a wall collapsed.~ [BD45829]
@45830 = ~You're talking about the attack on Dragonspear Castle, aren't you? That was a long time ago.~
@45831 = ~Then what happened?~
@45832 = ~We found ourselves in a dark space. I remember linking arms so we wouldn't lose each other. When we saw the glow of fungus, we made our way toward it.~
@45833 = ~Another creature had also seen the light. A two-headed giant with a club as big as a man.~
@45834 = ~What happened next? ~
@45835 = ~Another creature was attracted by the glow—a two-headed giant with a club as big as a man. It attacked without provocation. We defended ourself, but killing the monster cost us our lives.~
@45836 = ~And you've been here ever since?~
@45837 = ~A grim tale. Thanks for that, my life hasn't been near bleak enough, of late.~
@45838 = ~The weak die. As it has always been, so it shall always be.~
@45839 = ~Yes, Dragonspear Castle! We fled into the caverns, seeking escape. We followed a light into a cavern... unfortunately, we weren't the only ones. A two-headed giant killed us, though we managed to slay it before we fell.~
@45840 = ~And you've been here ever since?~
@45841 = ~A grim tale. Thanks for that; my life hasn't been near bleak enough of late.~
@45842 = ~There's some satisfaction to be had in that, I suppose...~
@45843 = ~We wander this place endlessly now, unable to find our path to the Fugue Plane. These caverns all look the same to our dead eyes. Can you help us?~ [BD45843]
@45844 = ~I will help you any way I can.~
@45845 = ~I suppose you'll haunt me if I don't.~
@45846 = ~All I have to offer the likes of you is one final death.~
@45847 = ~That ghost's voice is so familiar... Mistress spirit, if I may, can I ask you your name?~ [BD45847]
@45848 = ~Do you know her, Glint?~
@45849 = ~I don't know about you, but I'd remember if I had ever met a ghost woman previously. All these ghosts, for example, are complete strangers.~
@45850 = ~Another one of your stories, Glint?~
@45851 = ~No, I... mistress spirit, if I may, could I ask your name?~
@45852 = ~In life, I was called Litla Barkersdottir.~ [BD45852]
@45853 = ~Barkersdottir! My mother's family name. You must be a relative of mine, an ancient one. Rhonda will be SO jealous when she finds out I got to talk to a ghost of our ancestors!~
@45854 = ~We'll do whatever we can to lay your ancestor to rest, Glint.~
@45855 = ~I love family reunions. Other people's families, anyway. Mine have left something to be desired.~
@45856 = ~Say your farewells and be quick about it. I would be about our business sooner than later.~
@45857 = ~Our remains lay at your feet. If you find a way to reach the Fugue Plane, put what's left of us upon the path, that we may pass on.~
@45858 = ~I'll help you find peace. You have my word on that.~
@45859 = ~Sure. If I should come across a portal to the afterlife, I'd be happy to pop you in.~
@45860 = ~If that's what it will take to silence you, I'll find a way to make it happen.~
@45861 = ~I've a better idea—if I destroy you now, you'll find peace all the sooner.~
@45862 = ~You have our thanks. Fare thee well.~
@45863 = ~Smash! ~
@45864 = ~I'm not helpless, spirit. Attack me and I'll put you back in your grave.~
@45865 = ~You want me to smash you? Very well, if you insist.~
@45866 = ~Wait, there's no need for us to fight!~
@45867 = ~You've got two heads and not a useful thought in either of them. I'm not your enemy, you bloody great oaf.~
@45868 = ~M'Khiin, is there any chance you can talk some sense into this spirit?~
@45869 = ~I am a priest who has communed with many spirits. Talk to me—if my words fail to please, you can always try to smash then.~
@45870 = ~No need to smash! I'm still looking for your club.~
@45871 = ~Here, spirit. I found the club you lost.~
@45872 = ~Maybe...? Ghost! Open your eyes. See me. Talk with me.~ [BD45872]
@45873 = ~Break your legs and crush your ribs me will!~
@45874 = ~You stab me with shiny bright bits. Eat your skulls me will!~
@45875 = ~I am not the one who stabbed you. You died long ago.~
@45876 = ~While my skull would make a tasty treat for most of those inclined to make a meal of it, I'm afraid its delectable delights would likely be lost on you, being a ghost and all.~
@45877 = ~Speak quickly, spirit. Give me a reason not to kill you again.~
@45878 = ~Me... dead? ~
@45879 = ~Your body is, but your spirit lingers on here. Have you any idea why?~
@45880 = ~It happens to the best of us. Don't be too upset—as far as dead giants go, you're pretty lively. Why is that, do you think?~
@45881 = ~As dead as you are stupid. You probably don't even know why you haunt this place, do you?~
@45882 = ~In battle, me drop club. Good club, made of leg bone. Came from Grampop. Can't leave without club.~
@45883 = ~I'll look for your club. If I find it, I'll return it to you here. Agreed?~
@45884 = ~Wait, was the club given to you by your grampop or made FROM your... actually, I don't want to know.~
@45885 = ~A club? This is why you cling to the mortal realm?~
@45886 = ~Me want club back.~
@45887 = ~Club is back! Now me scare scrawny humans!~
@45888 = ~I returned the club to you that you might pass on to the next plane, not so that you might continue menacing this one.~
@45889 = ~Wait, I thought you wanted the club so you could move on to the afterlife?~
@45890 = ~Your idiocy reaches heights I never imagined possible.~
@45891 = ~Here, me give present to you. Take loincloth.~
@45892 = ~Uh, I don't really want your loincloth. Thank you though. No, please. Leave it on.~
@45893 = ~What are you doing... no, NO. I do NOT need to see this.~
@45894 = ~Cover yourself, monster! I think I'm going to be sick.~
@45895 = ~He didn't really need the club to scare ʺscrawny humans.ʺ~ [BD45895]
@45896 = ~Me go now!~
@45897 = ~We feel the pull of the Fugue...~
@45898 = ~Go through the portal and you will reach the afterlife. I hope you find peace there.~
@45899 = ~That would be the giant portal right behind you.~
@45900 = ~Move on, then, and leave this place to the living.~
@45901 = ~Goodbye, Lilta.~
@45902 = ~Thank you, my ancestor. I'm glad to know my bloodline has bred such strong and good-hearted kin.~
@45903 = ~Oh, uh, that it has. Yes, indeed, you won't find a stronger or more good-hearted bunch than our family. Why, once I was awarded a medal—~
@45904 = ~Glint. It's time to say goodbye.~
@45905 = ~Pay no attention to him, ma'am. He tends to ramble. ~
@45906 = ~The ghosts have waited long enough to move on. Let's not hold them up any longer.~
@45907 = ~Right. Of course. Farewell, then!~
@45908 = ~We can give you nothing but our thanks. Go in peace.~
