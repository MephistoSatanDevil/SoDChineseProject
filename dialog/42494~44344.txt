@42495 = ~And you're just going to hand it over to the elf, aren't you? You make me sad, <CHARNAME>.~ [BD36496]
@42496 = ~I'm a half-elf, lady. And I've got more than enough grating voices in my head right now, so I'll thank you for not adding yours to the din.~ [BD36497]
@42497 = ~You'll give me the potion, <CHARNAME>?~ [BD36498]
@42498 = ~Stick with me and we'll find all the ingredients you need. I promise.~
@42499 = ~Of course.~
@42500 = ~For 100 gold pieces, I will.~
@42501 = ~Done. Hand it over. ~
@42502 = ~I need them. They're my best chance of getting Adoy out of my head—OH YES, I WILL GET YOU OUT OF MY HEAD! IT'S COMING, BELIEVE YOU ME!~ [BD42502]
@42503 = ~The feather and potion, here, take them. Come with me and I'll help you find the other ingredients as well.~
@42504 = ~Here are the feather and the potion. There is a Flaming Fist camp not far from here. Perhaps you'll be able to find some of the other ingredients there.~
@42505 = ~I knew it was a long shot. Thanks. ~ [BD36506]
@42506 = ~There is a Flaming Fist camp not far from here—a little more comfortable than this cell, but not by much. Wait for me there until I return.~
@42507 = ~I may have need of you in the coming days. Await me at the Flaming Fist camp down the road.~
@42508 = ~Release me from this cage, worms! Release me and face my wrath! ~ [BD42508]
@42509 = ~Dorn Il-Khan. I never thought I'd see you caged.~
@42510 = ~Who in their right mind would choose to face the wrath of the mighty Dorn Il-Khan?~
@42511 = ~Name yourself, half-orc. Tell me how you came to be caged by the crusade.~
@42512 = ~You are in no position to make demands.~
@42513 = ~I am Dorn of the clan Il-Khan. Release me! ~ [BD42513]
@42514 = ~I am <CHARNAME>, hero of Baldur's Gate. Give me one good reason why I should let you out of that cage.~
@42515 = ~Perhaps I will—after you tell me how you came to be in that cage to begin with.~
@42516 = ~I will release you, Dorn Il-Khan, you're clearly no friend to the Shining Lady.~
@42517 = ~I sought to kill the priest Hormorn—one of Caelar's inner circle of advisors. I failed to anticipate the Barghest's interference.~ [BD42517]
@42518 = ~You'll not hear from the Barghest again, but there are plenty more where he came from. Join me. Together, <CHARNAME> and Dorn Il-Khan will bring Caelar to her knees.~
@42519 = ~Go with these mercenaries, Dorn Il-Khan. They'll take you to our camp.~
@42520 = ~Open the half-orc's cage. Take him back to the camp. He will join us on our journey to Dragonspear.~
@42521 = ~<CHARNAME>. So you are behind the crusade's troubles. Well done. I had hoped to do much the same myself. ~ [BD42521]
@42522 = ~The crusade is a fool's quest. All who flock to the Shining Lady's banner are blinded by a false light. And the blind are easy to kill—or so I believed.~ [BD42522]
@42523 = ~I am with you. Hormorn is beyond my reach now, but I will see more crusader blood shed ere I am done.~ [BD42523]
@42524 = ~Are you sure that's a good idea...?~
@42525 = ~Do as they say, little man. You have nothing to fear from me. I hunt bigger prey than you.~ [BD42525]
@42526 = ~I shall await you in this camp you speak of. Fare thee well until then.~ [BD42526]
@42527 = ~I'm pretty sure it's a bad one. But bad ideas are my favorite kind...~ [BD42527]
@42528 = ~What does it matter? This one reeks of blood and treachery. He is where he belongs.~ [BD42528]
@42529 = ~You wound me, dear lady. I seek the crusade's destruction, as you must, or you would not be here now. We should be working together. As to how I found myself here...~ [BD42529]
@42530 = ~No one at all. Minsc stands ready!~ [BD42530]
@42531 = ~A cage is the proper place for one such as this.~
@42532 = ~You know nothing of me, woman. You would not stand where you are if we didn't share the same goals.~ [BD42532]
@42533 = ~It might be best to leave the half-orc where he is. The crusaders could have had good reason to cage him.~ [BD42533]
@42534 = ~Huzzah!~
@42535 = ~Cheers for the hero!~
@42536 = ~The hero! The hero!~
@42537 = ~Thank you for everything you did for us.~
@42538 = ~I dub thee the hero of Bridgefort!~
@42539 = ~Bridgefort still stands! The crusade will be broken!~
@42540 = ~Death to Caelar and all who serve her!~
@42541 = ~ 'Twas a hard battle, well fought.~
@42542 = ~Good job with the crusade. They don't call you hero for nothing.~
@42543 = ~Next stop, Dragonspear Castle.~
@42544 = ~We've got Caelar on the run now.~
@42545 = ~The Shining Lady doesn't shine so bright anymore.~
@42546 = ~Good work taking care of Bridgefort. Are you ready for Dragonspear?~
@42547 = ~No sleep till Dragonspear! Yeah!~
@42548 = ~Care for a drink, hero? You earned it.~
@42549 = ~Victory for the Flaming Fist! Death to the crusade!~
@42550 = ~Caelar's had her first taste of Flaming Fist knuckle. But not the last.~
@42551 = ~Caelar will rue the day she crossed Baldur's Gate.~
@42552 = ~Halt! Who goes— Oh, it's you again. What do you want? ~
@42553 = ~The same thing I wanted before: to join the Shining Lady's crusade.~
@42554 = ~I bring word from Caelar. Where is the camp commander?~
@42555 = ~From you? Nothing.~
@42556 = ~How bad do you want it? 200 gold pieces bad?~
@42557 = ~I don't have that much gold.~
@42558 = ~You asked for 100 last time.~
@42559 = ~No. Not that bad.~
@42560 = ~Aye, and I bet you're wishing you'd given it to me now. Hand over 200 gold or begone. ~
@42561 = ~Fine. Here.~
@42562 = ~I don't have that much.~
@42563 = ~Look at me. LOOK at me. Not letting me into the camp is a mistake, one I promise you'll regret the rest of your life. Don't make it.~
@42564 = ~Welcome to the crusade.~
@42565 = ~That's a pity. Come back when you do.~
@42566 = ~Be on your way, then.~
@42567 = ~I live in Caelar's light. I have no regrets. Begone.~
@42568 = ~Ho there. Enjoying life in Caelar's service? ~
@42569 = ~Very much so.~
@42570 = ~It's life in an army, and a largely untrained one at that. I won't complain, I've seen worse, but it's not great.~
@42571 = ~Why would I enjoy serving the will of another?~
@42572 = ~It only gets better, you know. I can't wait for what comes next.~
@42573 = ~Give it time. You'll come around.~
@42574 = ~You serve the Shining Lady. There can be no greater honor than that. Give it some time. You'll come around.~
@42575 = ~You there. What are you up to? ~
@42576 = ~Nothing, sir.~
@42577 = ~I've been tasked with delivering a message to one of our people at the gate, sir.~
@42578 = ~I'm looking for a man named Munsch. He's an assistant to General Cordell.~
@42579 = ~That's no business of yours.~
@42580 = ~Idle hands do our enemies' work. You have the look of a seasoned combatant. Go assist Lieutenant Kharm in training those less fortunate than yourselves. I would have them survive the coming trials if possible. ~
@42581 = ~Breaking Bridgefort won't be so big a trial, will it?~
@42582 = ~I'll do what I can for them.~
@42583 = ~They'll need more than I can provide to do that.~
@42584 = ~I speak of what comes after—when we achieve our glorious purpose. ~
@42585 = ~Of course, my lord. Bridgefort is but a small stone in the path we walk to achieve our final goals.~
@42586 = ~Oh, right. Our glorious purpose. Um, what is that again?~
@42587 = ~Caelar will lead us to victory.~
@42588 = ~When the time is right, you will learn. Come to the bonfire tonight for your indoctrination.~
@42589 = ~Well, be about your business, then.~
@42590 = ~LIEUTENANT Cordell. Munsch flatters his commander, and himself in the bargain.~
@42591 = ~Not my business? Tell me, who is your superior officer? I would have words with them about the attitude of their subordinates.~
@42592 = ~Delgar Munsch.~
@42593 = ~I report to Colonel Cordell.~
@42594 = ~The Barghest.~
@42595 = ~I serve Hormorn.~
@42596 = ~I serve Caelar, as do we all.~
@42597 = ~I am honored to serve Lieutenant Kindt.~
@42598 = ~That is true, and none are more devoted to her cause than I. But it is Caelar's will that all in this camp answer to me. When next we meet, be sure to show the proper respect.~
@42599 = ~You don't wear the robes of the Revered.~
@42600 = ~Not all of us do.~
@42601 = ~Hormorn's business took me somewhere the robes would not be welcome.~
@42602 = ~That doesn't alter the fact that I answer to Hormorn.~
@42603 = ~Really? I'll have to speak with the Revered Brother about this...~
@42604 = ~Well said. Be about your business, then.~
@42605 = ~And they will have it. The gods smile upon us. Even so, we have a duty to train those who need it for the task at hand.~
@42606 = ~A general is only as strong as his—or her—soldiers. Go help Kharm.~
@42607 = ~Next time you speak to a superior officer, show them the respect they're due. Now be about your business.~
@42608 = ~There is no Lieutenant Kindt in this camp. Die, heretic!~
@42609 = ~You lie well. But not well enough!~
@42610 = ~I told you to be about your business. ~
@42611 = ~At once, sir.~
@42612 = ~You did tell me to do that, and so I did it.~
@42613 = ~And so I will be, when I choose.~
@42614 = ~If you had done as I said at once, I would not have had to say it twice. Do not make me repeat myself again.~
@42615 = ~This is a place for soldiers, not jesters. Now do as I command.~
@42616 = ~And now you have nothing to do? Here, in a camp laying siege to an enemy fort? I don't believe it.~
@42617 = ~Come on, come on. ~
@42618 = ~Where are we going?~
@42619 = ~If I must.~
@42620 = ~I don't think so.~
@42621 = ~The waiting room.~
@42622 = ~We don't have time to wait, <CHARNAME>. People in Bridgefort are getting sick...~
@42623 = ~I'm afraid you do.~
@42624 = ~Something about the way you say that makes me think you're not the one who should be afraid right now.~
@42625 = ~You're no messenger. Take <PRO_HIMHER>!~
@42626 = ~At last, the time for violence has arrived. Come, crusader! Let Minsc introduce your face to the dirt!~
@42627 = ~Damn it, <CHARNAME>! He believed you! We almost had a clear shot at the Barghest and you threw it away!~
@42628 = ~And here we go again...~
@42629 = ~Munsch! Who've you got with you?~
@42630 = ~A messenger who wants an audience with the Barghest.~
@42631 = ~Then why're you walking <PRO_HIMHER> past the Barghest's tent? I just saw him there.~
@42632 = ~I'm not just takin' 'em to see the Barghest, idiot. I've got this. You just worry about getting your people ready to face the Hells.~
@42633 = ~This is the best chance we'll get to scout the camp, <CHARNAME>. We need to get out of these cages, quickly. ~ [BD42633]
@42634 = ~The prisoner's escaped! Get him!~
@42635 = ~I know who you are. I'm a miner from Nashkel. I've never forgotten what you did for our town. If it weren't for you, my family and I might have starved.~
@42636 = ~I'm glad I could help.~
@42637 = ~You recognize me?~
@42638 = ~My actions weren't for your gain.~
@42639 = ~Whatever else might happen, I'd know you anywhere. Not everyone in the camp would, even though I heard they're looking for you. They only got a rough description of you. I won't say a word to the commanders, though. Consider it thanks for what you did for Nashkel.~
@42640 = ~Here, I'll even let you out of the cage. Be careful in camp and don't tell anyone who you really are. They want to capture you bad. Don't know why, and don't want to find out.~
@42641 = ~Thanks again, hero. I'd better get back to my post.~
@42642 = ~Be careful in camp and don't tell anyone who you really are. They want to capture you bad. Don't know why, and don't want to find out.~
@42643 = ~Let us out! Free us, <PRO_RACE>!~
@42644 = ~Open these cages! OPEN!~
@42645 = ~Ignore the trolls. You're nothing but meat to them. I, however, have more to offer—if you release me.~ [BD42645]
@42646 = ~You have nothing to offer me.~
@42647 = ~Dorn Il-Khan. I never thought I'd see you caged. What happened?~
@42648 = ~Who are you? How came you to be a prisoner of the crusade?~
@42649 = ~Don't pretend you're any different. I've seen how you treat your enemies, Dorn Il-Khan.~
@42650 = ~<CHARNAME>. What are you doing here—? No, I don't care. Open the cage. Free me.~ [BD42650]
@42651 = ~You cannot leave me here. Open this cage. Open it, damn you!~ [BD42651]
@42652 = ~And us. Let us out too!~
@42653 = ~Silence, vermin. Sentient creatures are talking. What are you waiting for, <CHARNAME>? Release me.~ [BD42653]
@42654 = ~Give me one good reason why I should even consider letting you out of that cage.~
@42655 = ~I'm afraid I can't do that—not yet. Be patient. I shall return for you when I have done what I need to do.~
@42656 = ~Perhaps I will—after you tell me how you came to be in that cage to begin with.~
@42657 = ~If I do, will you fight the crusade at my side?~
@42658 = ~I don't take orders from half-orcs in cages. Farewell—as well as you can, considering your circumstances.~
@42659 = ~I'll fight by your side, Lathander's side, the side of any who would see crusader blood spilled. ~ [BD42659]
@42660 = ~We'll see plenty of that ere this is done. Join me, Dorn Il-Khan.~
@42661 = ~How did you become the crusade's prisoner?~
@42662 = ~<CHARNAME> and Dorn Il-Khan. We'll make a good team, you and I.~
@42663 = ~Those crusaders who survive our onslaught shall tremble at our names.~ [BD42663]
@42664 = ~Hrmmm. If you serve Caelar, you would do well to leave me where I am. If you would see her and her peasant flock destroyed, we are allies by virtue of our mutual foe.~ [BD42664]
@42665 = ~I was captured while attempting to slay the Revered Brother Hormorn, priest of Caelar. I did not anticipate the one they call the Barghest interfering with my mission.~ [BD42665]
@42666 = ~You'll not hear from the Barghest again, but there are plenty more where he came from. Join me. Together, <CHARNAME> and Dorn Il-Khan will bring Caelar to her knees.~
@42667 = ~The Barghest?~
@42668 = ~And I cannot risk you interfering with mine. I'll return to free you when I've done what I came here to do.~
@42669 = ~There's a Flaming Fist camp to the south of here. Tell them <CHARNAME> sent you. They'll take care of you until I return.~
@42670 = ~Caelar is no goddess. She has no priests. Why would you seek this Hormorn's death?~
@42671 = ~He commands the crusaders stationed here. A powerful fighter. He will make a worthy sacrifice to my patron, Ur-Gothoz. ~ [BD42671]
@42672 = ~Join me, Dorn Il-Khan. Together, we will crush Caelar and all who serve her.~
@42673 = ~I'm sure he would, were I to release you.~
@42674 = ~Not far to the southeast you'll find a Flaming Fist camp. Tell them <CHARNAME> sent you. They'll take care of you until I return.~
@42675 = ~You freed me from my cage, and that is no small thing. I'll forgive your insolence—this time. When we meet again at this camp you speak of, do not be so imprudent as to try and command me again. ~ [BD42675]
@42676 = ~I do the bidding of my patron, Ur-Gothoz. 'Twas he who demanded Hormorn's death. I failed him.~ [BD42676]
@42677 = ~To what end?~
@42678 = ~Well, you're only one half-orc, and it is quite a large crusade. I'm sure he'll forgive you in time. I'm afraid you'll have to stay in the cage for now, but have no fear—I'll return to free you shortly.~
@42679 = ~Join me, and you'll have the chance to redeem yourself in his eyes. We'll shed crusader blood by the barrel.~
@42680 = ~I am Dorn Il-Khan.~ [BD42680]
@42681 = ~I know that name. You speak to the Butcher of Barrow, <CHARNAME>.~
@42682 = ~I am called that, though I did not earn the name.~ [BD42682]
@42683 = ~My master did not see fit to tell me his plans, and I am not so fool as to question him.~ [BD42683]
@42684 = ~You'll find a Flaming Fist camp southeast of here. Tell them <CHARNAME> sent you. They'll take care of you until I return.~
@42685 = ~Yeah, that's probably wise. All right, I can't let you out of the cage just yet, but take heart. I'll return to free you soon.~
@42686 = ~Join me, and you'll have the chance to redeem yourself. We'll bathe in crusader blood!~
@42687 = ~Oh yes. Yes, we shall. Look around. I saw two crusaders handling my blade not an hour past—the equipment stolen from me cannot be far from here.~ [BD42687]
@42688 = ~You can be of more assistance yet. The Shining Lady's pawns dared cage me. ME. They must pay.~ [BD42688]
@42689 = ~They will—later. For now, get clear of this place. There's a Flaming Fist camp to the south of here. Tell them <CHARNAME> sent you. They'll take care of you until I return.~
@42690 = ~And that's why I can't let you out of the cage just yet—you'll bring the entire crusade down on my head. Don't despair, though—I'll return to free you soon.~
@42691 = ~Join me, then. We'll make them pay together.~
@42692 = ~What does it matter? This one reeks of blood and treachery. He is where he belongs.~ [BD42692]
@42693 = ~I would sooner be a corpse than a prisoner. As to how I found myself here...~ [BD42693]
@42694 = ~I do not know if that is a good idea, my friend...~ [BD42694]
@42695 = ~You again. Release me—NOW. ~ [BD42695]
@42696 = ~I'm not going to do that.~
@42697 = ~Soon, Dorn. Soon.~
@42698 = ~Very well. My allies could use one such as you in the battle against Caelar.~
@42699 = ~It had better be. I am not known for my patience.~ [BD42699]
@42700 = ~A foolish mistake. You make an enemy of one you should cultivate as an ally. You may come to regret it.~ [BD42700]
@42701 = ~Excellent. Do it quickly lest the crusade realize what we're about.~ [BD42701]
@42702 = ~Actually, I've changed my mind.~
@42703 = ~I know what I'm doing, half-orc.~
@42704 = ~You play games with Dorn Il-Khan? Count yourself fortunate these bars are between us.~ [BD42704]
@42705 = ~Then do it.~ [BD42705]
@42706 = ~Yes. Yes! Few things taste so good as freedom. ~ [BD42706]
@42707 = ~Glad I could be of assistance.~
@42708 = ~Well, enjoy the freedom quietly, at least till you clear the camp. There's a Flaming Fist camp to the south of here. Tell them <CHARNAME> sent you. They'll take care of you until I return.~
@42709 = ~Your captors' blood would surely be one of them. Join me and we will drink it by the bucket.~
@42710 = ~You can be of more assistance yet. The Shining Lady's pawns dared cage me. ME. They must pay. ~ [BD42710]
@42711 = ~They will—later. For now, get clear of this place. There's a Flaming Fist camp to the south of here. Tell them <CHARNAME> sent you. They'll take care of you until I return.~
@42712 = ~Join me, then. We'll make them pay together.~
@42713 = ~Do I know you?~
@42714 = ~I am <CHARNAME>. I joined Caelar this past week.~
@42715 = ~I don't think so.~
@42716 = ~Stand aside. I've important matters to attend to.~
@42717 = ~Gods. There's too many damned people joining this bloody thing. Okay, okay. I'm Munsch, Delgar Munsch. Right hand to Colonel Cordell. What're you doing now?~
@42718 = ~The same as everyone else—waiting for the order to take Bridgefort.~
@42719 = ~Whatever will aid us in our glorious cause, sir. Currently I'm cleaning latrines.~
@42720 = ~What the general told me to, or I was until you stopped me. What's your name again?~
@42721 = ~I don't recognize you. ~
@42722 = ~I was among the farmers who came in last week.~
@42723 = ~Why would you? There's a lot of people here.~
@42724 = ~That's hardly my problem.~
@42725 = ~Aye. An' all of 'em got their assignments from me.~
@42726 = ~That sounds about right. Be about yer business, then.~
@42727 = ~I told you to do that, did I? And what's my name again?~
@42728 = ~You said I was allowed to call you "sir."~
@42729 = ~I forget your real name. The others all call you the Old Mule.~
@42730 = ~I gave you a chance, fool.~
@42731 = ~Intruders! Intruders in the camp!~
@42732 = ~Nice try.~
@42733 = ~I don't think so, either. Which is strange, you see.~
@42734 = ~I'm Delgar Munsch, right hand to Colonel Cordell.~
@42735 = ~All these people you see? I gave 'em their assignments. But I don't remember you.~
@42736 = ~Are you sure?~
@42737 = ~It's a big crusade.~
@42738 = ~And that's my problem?~
@42739 = ~I never forget a face, an' I don't remember yours. Guess I'll haveta start paying more attention.~
@42740 = ~Be about yer business, then.~
@42741 = ~Stand aside? Stand aside, <PRO_HESHE> says. Do you know who I am?~
@42742 = ~Have a care. You're talkin' to a superior officer.~
@42743 = ~Aye, it is that. An' gettin' bigger every day.~
@42744 = ~SILENCE!~
@42745 = ~It is time. Hormorn?~
@42746 = ~It is, Barghest. Thank you. And welcome to you, noble and worthy servants of Caelar.~ [BD42746]
@42747 = ~You know why we are here: to receive the blessings of the gods. To feel their divine light shining within you.~ [BD42747]
@42748 = ~You can feel it, can't you? In your hearts, in your very souls, you know, you KNOW we walk a righteous path.~ [BD42748]
@42749 = ~That path will take us to the darkest place. The most hideous of devils we will face, but we know no devil shall harm us.~ [BD42749]
@42750 = ~We do the will of the gods. We do the will of Caelar Argent. Our victory, in this realm and every other is assured!~ [BD42750]
@42751 = ~Thank you, Hormorn, and thank you, servants of the Shining Lady. Return to your tasks, secure in the knowledge that we have the favor of the gods. ~
@42752 = ~What the hells was that?~ [BD42752]
@42753 = ~The foundation upon which the Shining Lady has built her crusade. A confident voice, a few minor illusions, the monkeys eat it up.~
@42754 = ~They believe they do the will of the gods. ALL the gods.~ [BD42754]
@42755 = ~They will pay for their heresy, first with blood, then with their souls.~ [BD42755]
@42756 = ~Hail the light.~
@42757 = ~Against the darkness, we stand fast.~
@42758 = ~Be safe in Caelar's light.~
@42759 = ~We are the might and the light.~
@42760 = ~The darkest night is followed by the brightest day.~
@42761 = ~All shadows fall.~
@42762 = ~What was lost will be regained.~
@42763 = ~Hello again. ~
@42764 = ~It's time I left this place.~
@42765 = ~How are you?~
@42766 = ~I'm leaving. Where's the rope?~
@42767 = ~Here, take the rope.~
@42768 = ~Surviving. You?~
@42769 = ~The same. I need to get across the moat.~
@42770 = ~About the same. Keep it up.~
@42771 = ~I'll be better once I'm away from this place. Give me the rope that I may cross the moat, now.~
@42772 = ~You do the same.~
@42773 = ~Here. YOU'RE WELCOME.~
@42774 = ~Ho there! You want back in? ~
@42775 = ~Please.~
@42776 = ~I do. If you'd be so kind as to throw the rope over?~
@42777 = ~Not just now.~
@42778 = ~Here, catch the rope and I'll pull you across.~
@42779 = ~As you wish.~
@42780 = ~Who are you who would challenge Caelar? ~
@42781 = ~I am <CHARNAME>.~
@42782 = ~Who am I? I am the Flaming Fist. I am Baldur's Gate. I am the heir of Bhaal. I am <CHARNAME>!~
@42783 = ~You don't need my name. You'll not live long enough to use it.~
@42784 = ~Truly? Excellent news! I've never killed a god's child before.~
@42785 = ~Truly? This is excellent news. I've never killed a god's child before. I shall make your blood a gift to my lady.~
@42786 = ~You'll try, fiend.~
@42787 = ~Really? Your lady's into some strange stuff, friend...~
@42788 = ~You'll choke on yours first, fiend.~
@42789 = ~Die! Die for those who are lost! Die that they may be found again!~
@42790 = ~I survived two wars of Dragonspear. I faced the legions of the Nine Hells, and still I stand before you. Do you truly think yourself a match for me?~
@42791 = ~Insulting the Shining Lady will be your last mistake.~
@42792 = ~Die, villain!~
@42793 = ~You should never have left Baldur's Gate, <PRO_SONDAUGHTER> of Bhaal. But I'm glad you did.~
@42794 = ~<CHARNAME>. What did you see out there? ~
@42795 = ~A lot of crusaders and a lot fewer Bridgefortians. But the latter are ready to strike in concert with us. Assemble the Flaming Fist. It's time to bring this battle to the crusade.~
@42796 = ~So many things, yet only a fraction of what I want to see. I'll be heading out again soon.~
@42797 = ~Nothing I care to share with you.~
@42798 = ~I'll tell Corporal Duncan gather everyone and prepare for an assault. ~
@42799 = ~Do it quickly. I'll march out and attack with you.~
@42800 = ~Hold. I don't want a fight—not just yet.~
@42801 = ~Flaming Fist fall in! We go to liberate our friends. The Battle of Bridgefort begins now!~
@42802 = ~Thanks for the help.~
@42803 = ~If you learn anything you think may be of use, let Duncan know. The crusaders outnumber us two to one. We'll need every advantage we can get.~
@42804 = ~All right. I don't understand the delay, but the dukes said to follow your lead. Let me know when you're ready to move.~
@42805 = ~We're waiting as you ordered.~
@42806 = ~Wait no longer—we move on the crusader camp now.~
@42807 = ~Be patient, just a little longer.~
@42808 = ~I will tell you—when the time has come. But it is not here yet.~
@42809 = ~What word of the crusade, <CHARNAME>? ~
@42810 = ~I've spoken to Khalid, and the Bridgefortians are ready for an assault. It's time to take the fight to the crusade.~
@42811 = ~I've spoken to Khalid, and the Bridgefortians are ready for an assault. When you hear sounds of combat, the Flaming Fist should march on the crusade.~
@42812 = ~None that I care to share with you.~
@42813 = ~Finally, the time has come. I'll get everyone ready.~
@42814 = ~Do it quickly. I'll march out with you.~
@42815 = ~Excellent. Wait until you hear sounds of combat from the fort. I'm going to return there and fight with the defenders.~
@42816 = ~All right, people! It's time for the crusade to taste Flaming Fist steel. Prepare for battle! Let's go, let's go!~
@42817 = ~You're as helpful as always. Get out of here. Go do something useful, or at least stop wasting my time.~
@42818 = ~All right. We'll be ready to mobilize as soon as you give the word.~
@42819 = ~We're ready to attack, <CHARNAME>. Are you? ~
@42820 = ~The time is right. Start the attack.~
@42821 = ~Not quite yet.~
@42822 = ~Let me know when you're ready to go.~
@42823 = ~That's what I like to hear.~
@42824 = ~At last! Caelar's light against Il-Khan's darkness! Only one shall survive!~
@42825 = ~There's got to be an easier way to do this.~
@42826 = ~Ho ho! If there's one thing Mighty Voghiln likes better than drinking, it's—~
@42827 = ~What am I saying? There's nothing Voghiln likes better than drinking! But a good fight's good too—variety is the spice of life.~
@42828 = ~I just got out of there, and you want to go back?~
@42829 = ~You want me to risk my life for... what, exactly?~
@42830 = ~The sooner this Bridgefort business is done, the sooner we can move on to Caelar. Let's make quick work of it.~
@42831 = ~Selûne guide my hand as I work to free Bridgefort from Caelar's.~
@42832 = ~Let's butcher these bumpkin binswangers!~
@42833 = ~Bridgefort stands! The crusade will fall!~
@42834 = ~I'm the only one here who doesn't like bloodshed, aren't I?~
@42835 = ~I might be able to lift one of you at most, but I'm not here to take you away.~
@42836 = ~You're the ones who will die today!~
@42837 = ~All right, I'm leaving.~
@42838 = ~What is this place, anyway?~
@42839 = ~What exactly happened to Slug?~
@42840 = ~And whoever wins this fight takes control of your band, is that right?~
@42841 = ~Run away, little <PRO_RACE>! Might get hurt if you stay!~
@42842 = ~Time to fight! Winner chief!~
@42843 = ~I'm glad I was able to help you, Murs. I think you'll make a fine chief. Now I must go.~
@42844 = ~Wait! You've helped me—maybe I can do something for you. Listen: There are crusaders camped just inside the tunnel entrance. The caves beyond them used to belong to us.~
@42845 = ~To reach tunnels, you need go through shiner camp in front of our old caves.~
@42846 = ~Two sea devils lair past the camp. They're idiots, but they're vicious. I used to tell them stories to let me pass.~
@42847 = ~Go north, then west. Stick to main tunnel. There ghosts down there. Sometimes hear screams INSIDE walls.~
@42848 = ~South across river is dark druid's place. Never go there. Go west and north and you find tunnels under castle. Shiner guards there too. Not easy to get in.~
@42849 = ~Got it?~
@42850 = ~I think so.~
@42851 = ~Can you go over the directions again?~
@42852 = ~Remember, free Slug and others if you see them. You have friends for life. Ogres not look like much, but we good friends to have.~
@42853 = ~I will find your mate and rescue all the prisoners, I swear it.~
@42854 = ~You can never have too many ogres in your debt.~
@42855 = ~Find your own mate. I've better things to do than waste my time searching for an ogre bandit foolish enough to get captured.~
@42856 = ~You pushing luck, "chief."~
@42857 = ~You've proven your strength, but unless you promise to free Slug and the others, I'll kill you right now. ~
@42858 = ~All right, I'll find him. If I free Slug, can I count on your people to help me against the crusade?~
@42859 = ~Seems I have no choice. If I do this for you, you have to help me fight the crusade.~
@42860 = ~Not if I kill you first.~
@42861 = ~You insult Slug? Too far! Murs smash you—crush you like tick!~
@42862 = ~Turn west past camp and stay on trail. Southwest is dark druid's place. You no go there.~
@42863 = ~When trail turns, follow it north. That take you to tunnels that go under castle.~
@42864 = ~Got it?~
@42865 = ~Got it.~
@42866 = ~Hah! Arbinge leader! You go now—or die!~
@42867 = ~Go. I have to obey chief.~
@42868 = ~With Murs dead, I do not know what we'll do. But we'll figure something out. Love will guide us.~
@42869 = ~I'm sure it will, Kaelet. You'll do fine.~
@42870 = ~Yeah. Sorry about that. I'll try not to kill the next person you ally with.~
@42871 = ~Love makes fools of its victims.~
@42872 = ~We're closed. ~ [BD42872]
@42873 = ~This building is absolutely gutted. What happened here?~
@42874 = ~Are you sure? I was hoping to find some charcoal for dinner and a pile of ashes to sleep on tonight.~
@42875 = ~Are you trying to be funny?~
@42876 = ~Takos, I've found the items you wanted.~
@42877 = ~I managed to locate some of the items you lost.~
@42878 = ~What items am I looking for again?~
@42879 = ~Just checking up on you.~
@42880 = ~Oh, go away. I don't have the energy to talk to anyone. Let me choke on the ashes and die. ~
@42881 = ~Why don't you tell me what's wrong? Maybe I can help.~
@42882 = ~Can I have your stuff once you choke and die?~
@42883 = ~I'll go when I feel like going. What happened here?~
@42884 = ~If you insist. Farewell.~
@42885 = ~I don't HAVE any stuff. That's the problem.~
@42886 = ~I can see where this tale ends. Farewell.~
@42887 = ~Consider things from her perspective. You did attack the crusaders alone, and after she asked you not to. Your inn was burned down because of it, and you could easily have been killed. And you have children.~
@42888 = ~Maybe you're right. Doesn't matter now. I've lost everything. My family. My inn. Even my cloak and shield, the mirror...~
@42889 = ~I'll be here, sitting in the scorched ruins of my dreams.~
@42890 = ~I'll tell you my story if it means you'll go away. A pack of clinking crusaders got drunk and rowdy. I decided to throw them out. THEY decided to put my inn to the torch.~
@42891 = ~Rowdy enough to burn down your inn?~
@42892 = ~I like my wine as much as the next <PRO_RACE>, but I've never set a place on fire during my revels.~
@42893 = ~And then?~
@42894 = ~Finally, they seemed ready to leave, but when I asked for fair payment, they laughed in my face. I was a city watchman once. I wasn't going to take that. My wife screamed at me to stop, but I tackled the nearest around his knees!~
@42895 = ~I'm a former city watchman, so I lit into them. My wife screamed at me to stop, but I tackled the nearest around his knees!~
@42896 = ~I didn't do much damage before they knocked me out, more's the pity. I woke up on the road. The Sterling Silver was as you see it. My wife was... gone.~
@42897 = ~They killed your wife? I'm so sorry.~
@42898 = ~What do you mean, gone?~
@42899 = ~You avenged her death, I take it?~
@42900 = ~What? No, she wasn't dead, she was GONE. Left me a note saying she was off to Baldur's Gate to stay with her odious mother, and taking the children with her.~
@42901 = ~I'm glad she's not dead, but I deeply regret all you've had to endure.~
@42902 = ~Her actions were harsh. A decent spouse stands by you, even when your inn gets burned down by drunken crusaders.~
@42903 = ~For your sake, I hope there's a point to this tale.~
@42904 = ~Listen, she might be alive, but I'm good as dead. My inn is gone, my family is gone. What do I have? My cloak and shield, the mirror, all gone, forever.~
@42905 = ~I'm sorry you had to endure all that. I can't do anything about the inn or your family. I might be able to help with the heirlooms.~
@42906 = ~Heirlooms? Valuable heirlooms?~
@42907 = ~Did the crusaders take the heirlooms? I could slay them and claim the treasure as my payment.~
@42908 = ~Nothing, it seems. I'll be on my way. Farewell.~
@42909 = ~I've lost everything. My family. My inn. My cloak and shield, the mirror... I might have something to live for if I got the heirlooms back.~
@42910 = ~Tell me about the mirror.~
@42911 = ~Tell me about the cloak.~
@42912 = ~Tell me about the shield.~
@42913 = ~I'll do my best to return these items to you.~
@42914 = ~If I find the items—IF I find them—what can you offer me in return?~
@42915 = ~I make no promises, but I may seek out the items if it suits me.~
@42916 = ~Thanks, Takos. I'll see what I can do.~
@42917 = ~The mirror was my wife's. It's been in her family for generations. She told me it shows the truth of anything it reflects.~
@42918 = ~The cloak was given to me as a memento of five years' service in the Beluir city watch. It's my most treasured possession.~
@42919 = ~A duke of Baldur's Gate personally gave me that shield as a reward for bravery. If any of the items were stolen, that one would be.~
@42920 = ~Fare well? I'm sitting in the scorched ruins of my dreams, and you tell me to fare well. How'm I supposed to do that? When you have an answer, you come and find me. I'm not going anywhere.~
@42921 = ~Find all three heirlooms and I'll make it worth your time. And you can have free room and board for life on top of that.~
@42922 = ~I'll do my best to find them for you.~
@42923 = ~A worthy prize! I'll leave no scorched stone unturned.~
@42924 = ~I make no promises. I may seek out the items if it suits me.~
@42925 = ~I don't believe it. I thought for sure the bandits would murder you in the forest.~
@42926 = ~I'm not beaten so easily. ~
@42927 = ~Your confidence is appreciated. Now how about my reward?~
@42928 = ~I'm the one who does the murdering.~
@42929 = ~I found all three, but I believe I'll keep them for myself. They might fetch me a few gold at the next market I come across.~
@42930 = ~You truly are a hero, <PRO_SIRMAAM>. Here, please take this dart as a token of my gratitude. I considered using it to kill myself—but I've a reason to go on now, thanks to you.~
@42931 = ~Thank you.~
@42932 = ~A dart? That's all? I return priceless heirlooms to you and a dart is all I get for my efforts?~
@42933 = ~The dart will do for a start. What else can you give me?~
@42934 = ~Surely you can find a way to give a little something more to a fellow halfling?~
@42935 = ~I guess we do have to stick together. How about you take one of my heirlooms?~
@42936 = ~I'll take the mirror.~
@42937 = ~The cloak, please. I'll wear it with pride.~
@42938 = ~Give me the shield, then.~
@42939 = ~Here, take this dart. In my despair, I considered killing myself with it—that seems a trifle extreme now. Better you should have it.~
@42940 = ~Thank you.~
@42941 = ~A dart? I risk life and limb retrieving your priceless heirlooms and this is my reward?~
@42942 = ~I hope you're offering me more than that for my efforts. You think your life is hard now? Believe me when I say I can make it much, much worse.~
@42943 = ~Surely you can find a way to give a little something more to a fellow halfling?~
@42944 = ~Fine, fine. You've made your point. Since you helped me out, you can take one of the heirlooms.~
@42945 = ~I'll take the mirror.~
@42946 = ~The cloak, please. ~
@42947 = ~Give me the shield, then.~
@42948 = ~First crusaders, now you. This is a vicious world, to be sure. All right, take one of the heirlooms too. Will that be enough for you?~
@42949 = ~I'll take the mirror.~
@42950 = ~That cloak would look good on my shoulders.~
@42951 = ~Give me the shield, then.~
@42952 = ~I don't know if you've noticed, but my home and everything I owned BURNED DOWN. I can't spare anything else. ~
@42953 = ~Now I have to get going—if I'm lucky, I can catch my wife before she gets too far. Hopefully she'll take me back.~
@42954 = ~Good luck, Takos.~
@42955 = ~Her leaving in the midst of all your tragedy was a little cold. Are you sure you want her back?~
@42956 = ~Hope is a weakling's refuge. Demand her return.~
@42957 = ~I know something of the vagaries of love. Some poetry might help you win her back. I happen to know the perfect verse...~
@42958 = ~This isn't the first time she's left after the inn burned down. We'll make up right enough.~
@42959 = ~If you say so. Good luck, Takos.~
@42960 = ~Right, uh... I guess you'd best be going, then.~
@42961 = ~Be off, then.~
@42962 = ~You might win her over more easily with poetry. I happen to know the perfect verse...~
@42963 = ~That's sure to do the trick! I have a couple of potions here that didn't burn up. Here, take them, with my thanks.~
@42964 = ~I'm coming, my love!~
@42965 = ~Well, keep looking! The last one must be out there!~
@42966 = ~I'll see what I can do.~
@42967 = ~I haven't the time. Can't you take just the two? For a fellow halfling?~
@42968 = ~Oh, I see. You have something more important to do than help a "fellow halfling" whose entire life has burned to cinders. I know how it is. Very well.~
@42969 = ~Here, take this dart. In my despair, I considered using it to end my life. Perhaps you'll find a target more worthy of it.~
@42970 = ~Gods! You're WORSE than the crusaders. You came back to what, just to taunt me? What kind of person does such a thing?~
@42971 = ~I just wanted to see the look on your face. Here, take the heirlooms back.~
@42972 = ~One strong enough to beat you to a pulp if you say another word.~
@42973 = ~I found them, I deserve them. That's all there is to it.~
@42974 = ~They're mine! I'll take them from your corpse if I have to!~
@42975 = ~Stop there! Are you living or dead? ~ [BD42975]
@42976 = ~I'm alive—for the moment, at least.~
@42977 = ~Living, and I'd like to stay that way. How about you put the sword down?~
@42978 = ~Dead as a doornail. I got bored of my grave and thought I'd go for a stroll.~
@42979 = ~I'm more alive than you will be if you don't stop waving that sword in my face.~
@42980 = ~Isabella, please, they're clearly alive.~ [BD42980]
@42981 = ~Hmm... we'll see. What's your business here?~
@42982 = ~I saw your camp. Are you followers of the Shining Lady?~
@42983 = ~Just enjoying a frolic in the woods.~
@42984 = ~No business in particular. I'm just passing through.~
@42985 = ~Crusaders? Feh. Do we look like we've nothing better to do than fan a madwoman's ego? No. The work we do has actual value. Right now, we hunt a vicious undead creature. Keep out of our way.~ [BD42985]
@42986 = ~Frolic somewhere else. We're hunting a vicious undead creature and the last thing we need is a distraction. Stay out of our way.~
@42987 = ~We're hunting a vicious undead creature and the last thing we need is a distraction. Stay out of our way.~
@42988 = ~Really, Isabella. There's no need to be rude. ~
@42989 = ~What sort of creature are you hunting?~
@42990 = ~If your mission is so dangerous, perhaps you could use some help? For a fee, of course.~
@42991 = ~You seem ill equipped to fight anything truly dangerous.~
@42992 = ~Now if you'll excuse us, we've got things to do. Push off.~
@42993 = ~A vampire! So vile a creature shouldn't be allowed to exist. Let me help you destroy it.~
@42994 = ~I am a holy warrior. Please, let me assist you in this worthy venture.~
@42995 = ~I'll leave you to seek out your fiend, then.~
@42996 = ~That's a nice shield you have there. You wouldn't happen to have found it in a halfling's inn, would you?~
@42997 = ~Your aid would be appreciated, my <PRO_LADYLORD>.~
@42998 = ~We have the vampire cornered. He's riddled the path with traps so we can't get to him, but by the same token, his only way out is through us. Meet us here after dark if you want to help us finish this.~ [BD42998]
@42999 = ~I'll be here.~
@43000 = ~I'll think about it.~
@43001 = ~Fight your own battles.~
@43002 = ~What's that supposed to mean? ~
@43003 = ~A shield went missing when the Sterling Silver burned down. Did you find it?~
@43004 = ~I'm not saying you DID take the shield, but I don't know that you DIDN'T.~
@43005 = ~It means I think you're a thief. Hand over the shield.~
@43006 = ~We need the shield more than some innkeeper. Drop the matter or I'll run you through.~
@43007 = ~There's no need for violence, Isabella. Our enemy is the vampire.~
@43008 = ~If I help you kill the vampire, will you give me the shield?~
@43009 = ~That shield doesn't belong to you.~
@43010 = ~Give me the shield or I'll take it from you.~
@43011 = ~Yeah, that should work. All right. When the vampire's destroyed, the shield is yours.~
@43012 = ~Touch this shield and you'll regret it. My blade is sharp and ready for battle.~
@43013 = ~Apologies, but my companion is rather hot-tempered. She's not given to making idle threats, though—I'd back off if I were you.~
@43014 = ~If I help you kill the vampire, will you give me the shield?~
@43015 = ~One way or another, I'm taking that shield.~
@43016 = ~You leave me no choice!~
@43017 = ~Suit yourself. If that vampire shows up while you're here, though, you'll not have an option.~
@43018 = ~Who's there? ~ [BD43018]
@43019 = ~It's me, <CHARNAME>.~
@43020 = ~Blah! I want to suck your blood!~

@43030 = ~Your name means nothing to me—all I care about is the reward I'll receive for ending you.~
@43031 = ~A harsh philosophy. I've done neither you nor these fanatics any harm, <PRO_RACE>, yet they would see me destroyed. I ask you, is this right?~ [BD43031]
@43032 = ~My name is Tsolak, though that is of little consequence. What matters is that I've done no harm to these fanatics so bent on my destruction. I ask you, is this right?~ [BD43032]
@43033 = ~Enough talk! Kill the monster—now!~ [BD43033]
@43034 = ~Let him speak, Isabella.~
@43035 = ~A better plan is to kill you, Isabella. You've probably collected some fine magic items in your time as a vampire hunter. I want them.~
@43036 = ~Die, vampire!~
@43037 = ~You're either with him or us. What'll it be?~
@43038 = ~If I must make a choice, the vampire dies, obviously.~
@43039 = ~Talk sense to your partner, Ikros. I don't want to fight you.~
@43040 = ~It'll be trouble if you don't ease up. I don't respond well to ultimatums.~
@43041 = ~I'll drain you dry and use you corpses as cordwood!~
@43042 = ~I trust Isabella's judgment. Even if I didn't, I'm not so foolish as to cross her.~
@43043 = ~Very well. Die, vampire!~
@43044 = ~I won't kill someone on her orders alone. Let the vampire say its piece.~
@43045 = ~If you stand with the monster, you stand against us. But you'll not be standing long!~
@43046 = ~If he has to speak, make him speak quickly.~
@43047 = ~Who are you, vampire?~
@43048 = ~What's your purpose here?~
@43049 = ~How many people have you fed on? How many have died at your hand?~
@43050 = ~My name is Tsolak, and I've done nothing to these hunters. I'm on a critical mission and can't be delayed. ~
@43051 = ~What mission is that?~
@43052 = ~You might not have hurt Isabella and Ikros, but you can't expect me to believe you've killed no one in order to feed.~
@43053 = ~I'm forbidden from revealing the details, but I've been on the road for some time now. I must reach Amn.~
@43054 = ~Even if you did nothing to these hunters, you must have killed many people in order to feed. ~
@43055 = ~I am what I am, but even a creature such as I can serve a purpose in this world. Let me pass and you will be richly rewarded by my master.~ [BD43055]
@43056 = ~Who is your master?~
@43057 = ~I can't let you go on killing people.~
@43058 = ~All right, but the reward had better be worth it.~
@43059 = ~Again, I cannot say, but I assure you he is very wealthy. ~ [BD43059]

@43061 = ~To make it worth my while to let you live? He'll need to be.~
@43062 = ~You ask that as though it might make a difference. I know better. Your holiness shines so bright it almost blinds. Nothing I could possibly say will stay your hand—so I'll not stay mine. Die!~
@43063 = ~You and I both serve a higher—and darker—purpose, <PRO_RACE>. We should not be enemies.~
@43064 = ~I serve my own purpose, vampire. There is none higher.~
@43065 = ~Creatures like us don't have friends.~
@43066 = ~Don't presume to tell me what should and should not be, bloodsucker.~
@43067 = ~I mean only that we both possess powers granted to us by a darker force. Together, we could destroy these self-righteous hunters.~
@43068 = ~Yes. We are kin that way.~
@43069 = ~I need something from them and nothing from you.~
@43070 = ~You have my thanks, <PRO_RACE>. Watch for my messenger!~ [BD43070]
@43071 = ~He's getting away!~
@43072 = ~You can never defeat me!~ [BD43072]
@43073 = ~Beard! The monster got away!~ [BD43073]
@43074 = ~This isn't over yet. Where could the creature have gone?~
@43075 = ~He shouldn't be hard to find. We'll just look for a badly injured and really angry cloud.~
@43076 = ~This is your fault. Why didn't you tell me it could turn into mist?~
@43077 = ~He must have returned to his tomb—it's somewhere down the path; we hadn't found it yet. He'll reform there, but it'll take time. Here, take this stake. If you can find Tsolak, stake him through the heart.~ [BD43077]
@43078 = ~This path is heavily trapped, and we haven't found the vampire's tomb. Here, take this wooden stake. If you can find Tsolak, stake him through the heart.~
@43079 = ~What are you waiting for? Go find the vampire!~
@43080 = ~<CHARNAME>? I have a message here for <CHARNAME>. ~
@43081 = ~I am <PRO_HESHE>.~
@43082 = ~What sort of message?~
@43083 = ~Hand it over, then.~
@43084 = ~Tsolak thanks you for your assistance and bid me deliver this brooch to you as a reward.~
@43085 = ~What news?~ [BD43085]
@43086 = ~Tsolak has been destroyed. He will kill no more.~
@43087 = ~I wanted to thank you for your help killing Tsolak. I wanted to, but I can't, as he was slain with no help from you whatsoever.~
@43088 = ~I've returned for my reward.~
@43089 = ~I've nothing of consequence to report. Farewell.~
@43090 = ~I had a feeling you wouldn't have difficulty finishing Tsolak off.~
@43091 = ~Few things will keep me from driving evil from the world wherever I find it.~
@43092 = ~Difficult or no, we agreed I would be rewarded for slaying the vampire.~
@43093 = ~Thanks. Now give me the shield, please.~
@43094 = ~Here, take this shield. It belonged to the halfling whose inn burned down east of here. Return it to him with my apologies. ~
@43095 = ~Yes, yes, of course. Here, take it.~
@43096 = ~And this gold as well, take it, please. May it aid you on your travels. ~
@43097 = ~Thank you. Good luck in your travels as well.~
@43098 = ~I never say no to gold.~
@43099 = ~A paltry sum, but I'll take it nonetheless.~
@43100 = ~Until we meet again. ~
@43101 = ~Tra la la la!~
@43102 = ~Hmmm hmmm mmmmm.~
@43103 = ~Do re mi mi mi mi...~
@43104 = ~Oh, hello! Apologies for not greeting you sooner. I was a bit... distracted? Didn't notice you.~
@43105 = ~No apology is necessary. I didn't want to disturb your song.~
@43106 = ~Were you singing to that rock?~
@43107 = ~That's hardly a surprise, considering the racket you're making.~
@43108 = ~I've learned the secret of the singing menhirs.~
@43109 = ~Get away from me!~
@43110 = ~I probably look a little strange, don't I? This is a very unusual stone, though. It fascinates me.~
@43111 = ~It looks old. What's that writing carved upon it? ~
@43112 = ~Do you always sing at natural objects that fascinate you?~
@43113 = ~You seem more than "a little strange." It's only a rock.~
@43114 = ~Would that I was capable of finding a rock so absorbing. I'll leave you to contemplate its mysteries.~
@43115 = ~It's not natural. I was walking the Coast Way, singing as I worked out a new song, when I heard the stone, humming!~
@43116 = ~Intriguing. Was it humming a particular song? Perhaps trying to communicate with you?~
@43117 = ~I'd think it was trying to talk to you, but what could a rock have to say?~
@43118 = ~Nonsense. You're imagining things.~
@43119 = ~At first, I thought I might be going mad, but there are menhirs like this all over this side of the crossing. They all responded to my humming.~
@43120 = ~When I sing to more than one, their tones last longer. They stop eventually, though. I'd try to find all of them, but the forest is too dangerous.~
@43121 = ~Thanks for sharing your story. I'll watch for these menhirs.~
@43122 = ~Can I try singing to your menhir?~
@43123 = ~Too dangerous for you, perhaps. I'll find them.~
@43124 = ~A pity. I have to be going now.~
@43125 = ~Could you tell me exactly where you found the menhirs?~
@43126 = ~Could you tell me exactly where you found the menhirs?~
@43127 = ~If you find them all and learn why they're singing, could you return and let me know? ~
@43128 = ~Of course.~
@43129 = ~Perhaps.~
@43130 = ~I'll be here, singing to the stone.~
@43131 = ~I'd be happy to mark their location on your map. Anything for another elf!~
@43132 = ~I'd be happy to mark their location on a fellow bard's map.~
@43133 = ~Anything else I can help with?~
@43134 = ~I don't believe so. I'll watch out for these menhirs.~
@43135 = ~May I sing to your menhir?~
@43136 = ~No. I have to go.~
@43137 = ~Where exactly did you find these other menhirs?~
@43138 = ~Where might I find these other menhirs you spoke of?~
@43139 = ~I see no reason why not. Just go right up to it and sing.~
@43140 = ~You did? That's wonderful! Tell me all about it!~
@43141 = ~The tale begins when the bard, Crommus, fell in love with the beautiful Carline...~
@43142 = ~No, I don't think I will. ~
@43143 = ~That's spectacular. Crommus's story will make an epic ballad. I can't thank you enough!~
@43144 = ~Good luck with your composing.~
@43145 = ~I'll receive a portion of any monies generated by this song, of course.~
@43146 = ~I find it an overly sentimental, pathetic story myself. There truly is no accounting for taste.~
@43147 = ~I can think of no nobler quest than helping out a fellow bard and a beautiful lady.~
@43148 = ~Please take this reed. It appears to be naught but an ordinary whistle, but it will bolster the abilities of any spellcaster that carries it. Now I must begin composing. This song will be my crowning achievement!~
@43149 = ~I have to start composing now. This will be my greatest song ever!~
@43150 = ~That's a rotten thing to do to a bard.~
@43151 = ~Wh-what? Why would you do that?~
@43152 = ~It's a great story. I would save its telling for myself.~
@43153 = ~Because I can.~
@43154 = ~Relax, Prin. I was making a joke, or trying to, at least. I'll tell you the story. The tale begins when the bard, Crommus, fell in love with the beautiful Carline...~
@43155 = ~You cruel, horrible person—get away from me! Begone, I'll not endure the sight of you another second. Go!~
@43156 = ~(The menhir emits a constant low-pitched hum.)~
@43157 = ~Uh, hello? Can you understand me?~
@43158 = ~(Hum at the menhir.)~
@43159 = ~(Sing at the menhir.)~
@43160 = ~(Sing a bard song at the menhir.)~
@43161 = ~I'll come back another time.~
@43162 = ~Safana, you're pretty charming. Can you try singing to the menhir?~
@43163 = ~I'll do my best, darling.~ [BD43163]

@43166 = ~(The menhir emits a pleasant tone.)~
@43167 = ~(The menhir emits a constant low-pitched hum.)~
@43168 = ~I've melted hearts of stone before. Why not?~ [BD43168]
@43169 = ~(A faint but pleasant voice speaks in your mind.)~
@43170 = ~One bard howls while the second bard babbles and the third stands nearby and sighs. Who are these minstrels? ~
@43171 = ~My guess is "anger, insanity, and sorrow."~
@43172 = ~Two lovers fighting over a maiden?~
@43173 = ~A man, who crawls on all fours as a baby and... no, that's not right.~
@43174 = ~The wind blowing in a tree next to a river.~
@43175 = ~Edwin, any ideas?~
@43176 = ~Dynaheir, do you know the answer?~
@43177 = ~I don't know.~
@43178 = ~Idiot! Isn't it obvious? A wind howls next to a babbling brook, shaking the leaves of a nearby tree. ~ [BD43178]
@43179 = ~Let me think but a moment. Yes, it seems to me that a strong wind, a flowing river, and a tree on the bank could make such a trio.~ [BD43179]
@43180 = ~(The voice in your mind speaks.) Not the answer intended, but a proper answer nonetheless.~
@43181 = ~(The voice in your mind speaks.) The answer has not been given. Now pay the price in flesh.~
@43182 = ~Did you bring me along to sing to rocks? Oh, fine. If it will get us moving again.~ [BD43182]
@43183 = ~(The menhir's hum turns harsh and grating.)~ [CASTB]
@43184 = ~"Pretty" charming? What kind of a backward compliment is that?~ [BD43184]
@43185 = ~(The menhir's hum turns to a bone-chilling wail.)~ [CASTB]
@43186 = ~(The menhir's hum turns to a hideous crackling sound.)~ [CASTB]
@43187 = ~At last, I am free! FREE!~ [BD43187]
@43188 = ~Who are you? Name yourself, spirit.~
@43189 = ~Great. I unleashed a ghost. Are you an evil spirit? Please don't be an evil spirit.~
@43190 = ~Tell me your name, shade, and do it quickly, lest I return you to the afterlife whence you came.~
@43191 = ~Crommus is my name. In life, I was a poor minstrel. No evil lurks in my transparent heart, I assure you.~
@43192 = ~How did you come to be trapped, Crommus?~
@43193 = ~You WOULD say that. Tell me your tale—then I'll decide what to do with your transparent heart and the rest of your organs.~
@43194 = ~Who imprisoned you? You must burn for revenge.~
@43195 = ~Carline meant nothing to Karnass. She was property, to be traded away for the best price possible. Artipheon offered him much for her hand.~
@43196 = ~I do remember hearing a story of Crommus the Minstrel, once, but it was long ago. Something to do with doomed lovers.~
@43197 = ~My tale is indeed a tragic one. I grew up in a village not far from here, though it has long turned to dust.~
@43198 = ~Mine is a tragic tale. I grew up not far from here, in a village now long turned to dust. A wealthy adventurer, Jeth Karnass, retired to the village and soon became our mayor. He had one child, a daughter—Carline.~
@43199 = ~Let me guess. She was very beautiful and you were very poor?~
@43200 = ~Stories of this sort usually end with a fellow getting run out of town, not turned into a singing-stone ghost.~
@43201 = ~Go on.~
@43202 = ~A familiar tale, hey Voghiln?~
@43203 = ~I might have been in a similar situation once or twice. Who can resist a pretty village girl?~
@43204 = ~Karnass had arranged Carline to marry the wizard Artipheon—a foul man, cruel and vicious, with the baleful gaze of a spider.~
@43205 = ~Why would Karnass want such a man to marry his daughter?~
@43206 = ~He had eight eyes?~
@43207 = ~Go on.~
@43208 = ~Perhaps time has clouded my memory... at any rate, he was very unpleasant. He would often cut into line at the bakery and buy all the cinnamon rolls.~
@43209 = ~Carline and I fell in love. She was beautiful as a spring day. She had a fondness for pinning flowers in her hair—I remember how prettily they drooped over her ear.~
@43210 = ~She begged to be released from her engagement to Artipheon, to no avail. And so she came to me and said, "If we can't be together in life, my love, we can in death."~
@43211 = ~She wanted you to make a lover's pact?~
@43212 = ~A little drastic, don't you think? Couldn't you have just run away together?~
@43213 = ~The passion of lovers is for death. Go on.~
@43214 = ~I paraphrased slightly. As I recall, her exact words were, "Father's impossible. Let's go to the coast and set up a flower shop." And so we fled. But Artipheon would not let Carline go. He pursued us, catching up to us just as we crossed the Winding Water.~
@43215 = ~I thought life preferable to suicide—we fled. But Artipheon would not let Carline go. He caught us just as we crossed the Winding Water.~
@43216 = ~He caught up to us just as we crossed the Winding Water. He paralyzed me with a spell and snatched Carline away as I watched helplessly.~
@43217 = ~He paralyzed me with a spell and snatched Carline away as I watched helplessly. Then in his rage he stole my voice and shattered it, binding each fragment in the petrified tooth of a great dragon.~
@43218 = ~That's terrible!~
@43219 = ~These menhirs are DRAGON TEETH? They look like ordinary rock to me.~
@43220 = ~And then?~
@43221 = ~Encase my voice in common stone? No. They're dragon teeth. Definitely.~
@43222 = ~Artipheon took Carline and left me to die. Since then, my spirit has wandered these woods, voiceless and alone—until now. Thanks to you, I can sing once more! Carline... come to me, my love...~ [BD43222]
@43223 = ~Since then my spirit has wandered, voiceless, in these woods. Thanks to you, my voice is free and I can sing once more!~
@43224 = ~Carline... come to me, my love...~
@43225 = ~What is this? Where am I? Who—? You! I remember you... Artipheon! Foul one! I will destroy you! DESTROY YOU ALL!~ [BD43225]
@43226 = ~Carline. All these years, I longed to call to you, but I couldn't—until now. Thanks to this kind stranger, we are together again.~
@43227 = ~I wish you and Carline all the best, Crommus.~
@43228 = ~I'd ask for a reward, but it's a rare ghost's purse that'll have any gold. Ah, well. I suppose a good deed will have be its own reward on this occasion.~
@43229 = ~Be off with you then, the both of you.~
@43230 = ~I was buried in a barrow not far from here, in the eastern side of the forest. Seek out my grave—whatever you find there, take with my blessing. But beware—an evil presence resides nearby.~
@43231 = ~Many thanks.~
@43232 = ~I'll feel better knowing I have permission, but in truth, I'd probably have taken anything I found there regardless.~
@43233 = ~I'll ransack the barrow and take all that I find.~
@43234 = ~May you find comfort and solace in the melodies of Milil, until we meet again. Farewell.~
@43235 = ~I'm afraid I have little to trade. When I fled the crusade, I had to leave much behind.~
@43236 = ~I'd like to see what you have for sale.~
@43237 = ~What can you tell me about the goings-on in the area?~
@43238 = ~Your troubles bore me.~
@43239 = ~I've returned, Herod. Teleria is dead. She was petrifying refugees for art, but I did my best to restore the victims.~
@43240 = ~Once, yes, but no longer. Everyone here left their lived behind when the crusade swept through the High Moor, and I am no different.~
@43241 = ~Everyone does seem troubled here. You've had some problems establishing this camp, I take it?~
@43242 = ~No one seems about to break into song and dance, that's for sure.~
@43243 = ~Sorrow and hardships are part of life.~
@43244 = ~Everyone here left their lives behind when the crusade swept through the High Moor, and I am no different. The crusaders have seized the Coast Way bridge, blocking the route north. And if losing our homes wasn't bad enough, we've started losing our friends now too.~
@43245 = ~People are going missing?~
@43246 = ~That's a shame. Can I see what you have for sale?~
@43247 = ~I've heard this tale of woe more times than I care to recall. I'd tell you to fare well if I thought you could be bothered to try.~
@43248 = ~We've had a spell of troubles. We're all refugees and we banded together for survival, but some of us have vanished. Five have gone missing so far, leaving all their possessions behind. It's a right mystery.~
@43249 = ~Have you any clues to what happened?~
@43250 = ~So their possessions are just lying around? Interesting. Tell me more.~
@43251 = ~They probably wandered into the woods and were devoured by wild beasts.~
@43252 = ~I don't know anything, really. But... you see that tall elf woman? Teleria's her name. She arrived right before the disappearances started. No one knows anything about her.~
@43253 = ~If I see the missing people, I'll let you know.~
@43254 = ~I'm not going to arrest or kill someone on your hunch. I'd just like a place to start looking.~
@43255 = ~Just tell me who you suspect. Don't worry, I won't tell them you pointed them out.~
@43256 = ~Hearsay at best. The woman is probably completely innocent and I won't disturb her. Farewell.~
@43257 = ~I don't like to speak without proof. ~
@43258 = ~I'm not going to arrest or kill someone on your hunch. I'd just like a place to start looking.~
@43259 = ~Just tell me who you suspect. Don't worry, I won't tell them you pointed them out.~
@43260 = ~Don't make me force you to speak.~
@43261 = ~All right, all right... see that tall elf woman? Teleria's her name. She arrived right before the disappearances started. No one knows anything about her.~
@43262 = ~The new arrival is the first suspected. Well, it's a place to start. I'll speak to her.~
@43263 = ~She and my knuckles are going to have a little talk. I'll find out what she's up to.~
@43264 = ~That will change shortly, if she knows what's good for her.~
@43265 = ~Go easy on her. I don't know for sure that she's involved. Luck to you.~
@43266 = ~I'm sorry, stranger. I'm afraid troubles are all we've got. People have been going missing and no one knows what to do about it. Five have vanished so far, leaving all their possessions behind.~
@43267 = ~Everyone here does seem... subdued. What problems are you having?~
@43268 = ~The camp seems in little danger of a song and dance outbreak, that's for sure.~
@43269 = ~I've heard more tale of woe more times than I care to of late, so I think I'll just leave you to your misery.~
@43270 = ~Gods, I hope not! ~
@43271 = ~Do you have any clues as to what might have happened?~
@43272 = ~You think it was a person who took them, then? Who? Why?~
@43273 = ~I don't deal in hope. Can you tell me anything else about the disappearances?~
@43274 = ~Luck to you.~
@43275 = ~I heard what you did. We're all grateful to you for getting to the bottom of this matter.~
@43276 = ~You're quite welcome.~
@43277 = ~I just happened to be in the right place at the right time for the right reward.~
@43278 = ~Someone had to resolve the issue. You people obviously weren't up to it.~
@43279 = ~I took up a collection among the refugees, and we'd like you to have the money as a reward. ~
@43280 = ~Very generous. Thank you.~
@43281 = ~Please, keep it. You need it more than I—I'm just happy I was able to help.~
@43282 = ~Convenient. Saves me the trouble of shaking everyone down individually.~
@43283 = ~Give it here, then.~
@43284 = ~Such generosity—such selflessness... If only the world had more like you. You'll always have friends here. Fare well on your travels.~
@43285 = ~Here you are. Thank you again for your help, and luck to you on your travels.~
@43286 = ~It's too bad we couldn't save the others, but at least no one else will be turned to stone. Thank you again. Luck on your travels.~
@43287 = ~What is it you want, stranger?~
@43288 = ~I was wondering if you might be able to tell me anything about these woods?~
@43289 = ~Conversation, mostly. You seem like an interesting person.~
@43290 = ~Nothing. I'll be going.~
@43291 = ~I heard some people have gone missing from this camp recently.~
@43292 = ~I know nothing of interest, and I value my privacy. Leave me alone.~
@43293 = ~Goodbye.~
@43294 = ~I've heard the same, but I don't know anyone who has vanished.~
@43295 = ~Herod tells me people started disappearing shortly after you arrived. He thinks you have something to do with the disappearances.~
@43296 = ~Have you seen anything suspicious?~
@43297 = ~Any ideas about what might have happened to the missing people?~
@43298 = ~Why would he say such a thing? ~
@43299 = ~You showed up right when people started disappearing.~
@43300 = ~No one knows anything about you.~
@43301 = ~You keep to yourself and don't seem like the other refugees.~
@43302 = ~That's very interesting that he would cast suspicion on me.~
@43303 = ~Are you suggesting Herod had something to do with the disappearances?~
@43304 = ~And understandable, considering the circumstances.~
@43305 = ~You have one chance to tell me everything you know.~
@43306 = ~There are too many people around. I can't say anything here. There's a clearing just inside the forest northwest of here. Meet me there—I'll tell you what I know.~
@43307 = ~I'm new, and I keep to myself—I'm an easy target, nothing more. But keeping my own counsel doesn't mean I don't hear things, though. Or see things.~
@43308 = ~What have you seen?~
@43309 = ~No one's accusing you of anything. Yet. But if you know something, you need to tell me now, before things get ugly.~
@43310 = ~If you value your life, you'll tell me everything you know, now.~
@43311 = ~Just inside the forest northwest of here there's a clearing with a small pond. I like to go there to think. Meet me there and I'll tell you what I know. ~
@43312 = ~And here you are. ~
@43313 = ~Indeed I am. Now tell me what you know of those who've gone missing.~
@43314 = ~What's with all the sculptures?~
@43315 = ~There's no one around to overhear us now. No more excuses—tell me what you know.~
@43316 = ~I was only passing by.~
@43317 = ~I'm still working on getting those two new subjects for you. I'll return soon.~
@43318 = ~As are you—but not for long.~
@43319 = ~I am an artist unlike this land has ever seen. These statues are my creations, taken from flesh and made perfect, eternal stone through magic. They are more beautiful than they ever were in life.~
@43320 = ~Five refugees... five statues. There's one mystery solved, at least.~
@43321 = ~Have you considered erosion? Wear and tear are going to break these figures right down.~
@43322 = ~Average work at best.~
@43323 = ~You're a clever one, aren't you? I had decided to add you as my next piece, but I cannot bring myself to do that to another elf. Begone now, before I change my mind.~
@43324 = ~I'll not turn my back on these petrified people.~
@43325 = ~You don't need to tell me twice.~
@43326 = ~They are my pride and my legacy. My display is not complete, though. With my assistant's help, I will add another piece to the exhibit. YOU.~
@43327 = ~Return these statues to life, elf. I'll not ask you again.~
@43328 = ~I'd rather die. And I'd MUCH rather you die.~
@43329 = ~I hope you're prepared to suffer for your art, you demented bore.~
@43330 = ~Wait a moment, let's talk about this. What if I could get you an even better subject?~
@43331 = ~I'll not bargain with a half-breed. Your very existence offends—but by my hand you will be ennobled, transformed into an object of significance and meaning. You will become art—this is my gift to you. Now hold still. This probably won't hurt.~
@43332 = ~An interesting proposal. Let me ask you something first. Have you seen the stone menhirs scattered throughout the forest?~
@43333 = ~Yes, I've noticed them.~
@43334 = ~Can't say that I have.~
@43335 = ~What possible difference could that make?~
@43336 = ~The singing ones? Yes, I activated them all and released the voice trapped within.~
@43337 = ~WHAT? You defaced the work of Artipheon? You vulgar brute! You'll pay for that!~
@43338 = ~They were placed here centuries ago by a powerful wizard. Though he is long dead, they stand as a testimonial to his artistic genius.~
@43339 = ~I want to create the same sort of legacy. Artipheon was a great wizard, a true inspiration. I would honor his memory with a tableau of petrified individuals. ~
@43340 = ~There is no cause greater than artistic expression. What pieces do you need to complete your tableau?~
@43341 = ~Your motives mean little to me. Just tell me what you need.~
@43342 = ~Teleria, I'm a wizard too and I see a flaw in your plan. These statues will never last. They are too perfect, too detailed. Anyone who sees them will know they're petrified people. Someone WILL try to restore one of your subjects to the flesh.~
@43343 = ~The woman is insane. We should kill her instead of wasting time.~
@43344 = ~I wouldn't even add you to my tableau, half-orc. Your face is too hideous. Die instead!~
@43345 = ~Oh? And what's that?~
@43346 = ~These statues will never last. They are too perfect, too detailed. Any intelligent person who sees them will know they're petrified people.~
@43347 = ~That doesn't matter! They'll be all the more impressed by my power. ~
@43348 = ~Sooner or later someone will try turning a person back to flesh. And once one person is reverted, the whole tableau will be ruined. ~
@43349 = ~And once one person is reverted, the whole tableau will be ruined. All that work, lost! You—you're right. I must leave—take some time to think, consider other ways I might honor Artipheon.~
@43350 = ~Before you go, do you have a way to turn these people back to flesh?~
@43351 = ~Don't let me see your face again.~
@43352 = ~You're not going anywhere. Your corpse will lie here among your victims, a monument to your own ego.~
@43353 = ~Here, take these scrolls. They'll return my beautiful statues to flawed flesh.~
@43354 = ~Farewell.~
@43355 = ~If I can't add you to my tableau, I'll see you destroyed!~
@43356 = ~To complete my tableau, I require an armored soldier and a handsome nobleman. Lure them here and you will be rewarded.~
@43357 = ~Consider it done.~
@43358 = ~They'll be poor substitutes for my beautiful face, but I'll get them for you.~
@43359 = ~Too much effort. I think I'll just kill you and take my reward from your corpse.~
@43360 = ~ONE two three four MARCH two three four...~
@43361 = ~Keeping your skills sharp, I see.~
@43362 = ~Report, soldier!~
@43363 = ~What in the Nine Hells are you doing?~
@43364 = ~May I have a word, soldier? I've a mission for you.~
@43365 = ~Doesn't do to get soft, not at all! The battle will come sooner than we think. HUP two three four.~
@43366 = ~Carry on, then. ~
@43367 = ~What are you doing? You're not really going to let Teleria turn this soldier into stone?~
@43368 = ~No, of course not.~
@43369 = ~I believe that was the bargain.~
@43370 = ~All right. Good.~
@43371 = ~Not going to happen. Soldier! Carry on and do NOT leave this camp.~
@43372 = ~Aye, sir!~
@43373 = ~Yes, sir!~
@43374 = ~I have a mission for you, soldier. ~
@43375 = ~I'm a ma'am, actually.~
@43376 = ~Yes, sir! ~
@43377 = ~Um... all right, fine. I've a mission for you. There's a clearing in the forest, not far from here. White flowers growing there can be used to make healing salves. I need you to gather some.~
@43378 = ~我能为你做什么，先生？~
@43379 = ~In the forest to the west, there's a small clearing. White flowers growing there can be used in healing salves. I need you to get some.~
@43380 = ~I'm under orders not to leave camp, sir! ~
@43381 = ~The healing salves are needed to heal our soldiers. Do you want them to die?~
@43382 = ~I'm a new officer brought in from another camp and I'm ordering you to go get those flowers.~
@43383 = ~The forest is a dangerous place, and I can see you're the strongest and most experienced soldier here. It has to be you.~
@43384 = ~Sir, yes, sir! I'll return as soon as I can!~
@43385 = ~Sorry, sir, you'll have to clear this with my commander.~
@43386 = ~Gods help me, no more, please. I've endured so much. I can take no more...~
@43387 = ~What's happened? Maybe I can help.~
@43388 = ~Oh dear, did you get mud on your silk robes?~
@43389 = ~Cease this sniveling or I'll give you something to moan about.~
@43390 = ~Your pardon, my lord. I was wondering, could you tell me what your noble insignia looks like?~
@43391 = ~Leave me to my misery. My wealth—stolen. My home—burned. I have nothing to live for. Nothing!~
@43392 = ~The Vessanal family's crest is a four-winged pegasus before crossed swords. Not that it means anything now.~
@43393 = ~You may be in better shape than you realize. In the woods just inside the forest's edge, in a clearing, I saw a locked chest. It had that very seal on its lid.~
@43394 = ~Where, where? Perhaps I'm not destitute after all! ~
@43395 = ~Just inside the forest's edge, in a clearing by a pond. ~
@43396 = ~Oh, thank you, stranger! There's a silver piece in that chest with your name on it! ~
@43397 = ~No! Aaaaaaugh!~
@43398 = ~You did well, finding me such fine subjects. Already I can envision their place within my great work.~
@43399 = ~Excellent. I'll just take my reward and be on my way.~
@43400 = ~I enjoyed luring these fools to their death. ~
@43401 = ~I care nothing for their fate, I only want payment.~
@43402 = ~Here, take this figurine. With it, you can summon my golem assistant.~
@43403 = ~Thank you.~
@43404 = ~I can always use an extra pair of hands.~
@43405 = ~Hand it over.~
@43406 = ~I think it best that we not cross paths again. Farewell. ~
@43407 = ~Forgive me. I meant no offense.~
@43408 = ~Go away! I'm busy here.~ [BD43408]
@43409 = ~You are Wynan Hess, are you not? Khalid told me to seek you out regarding the fort's defenses.~
@43410 = ~Oh, fine. Defenses, what've we got...? Not much. A few fighters, some mercenaries and guards. Most here are travelers, trapped inside when the crusade crossed the Winding Water.~
@43411 = ~I can tell. Vitally important work it is too, staring at a corner.~
@43412 = ~Watch your tone, old man.~
@43413 = ~I maintain the wards that protect us from the crusade's siege weapons. They—wait. Another wizard is fighting me. I must concentrate. I need to—~ [BD43413]
@43414 = ~I'm working the wards that keep us safe from siege weapons, and to do that I need to concentrate. Begone!~
@43415 = ~Damn it! Damn, damn, damn, damn, damn!~ [BD43415]
@43416 = ~Someone help Lexa!~
@43417 = ~She's beyond our help, son.~
@43418 = ~Wynan? I th-thought you were shielding the fort from this kind of attack?~ [BD43418]
@43419 = ~What's going on here, Hess? You were supposed to protect us from this sort of attack!~
@43420 = ~And I did, for as long as I could. The crusade has mages too, you know. I couldn't maintain the redblooding wards—you'd have done no better.~ [BD43420]
@43421 = ~Forgive me—I shouldn't have distracted you.~
@43422 = ~It happens to every mage once or twice in their life, I'm told.~
@43423 = ~What's done is done. We have greater concerns now.~
@43424 = ~There's nothing to be done about it now. ~
@43425 = ~I feel sick. Something strange is happening.~
@43426 = ~This attack isn't over yet. The stone is emitting a negative energy field—sapping the strength of all around it.~
@43427 = ~In truth, I probably couldn't have held the shield much longer anyway. The longer this mess lasts, the weaker I grow.~
@43428 = ~Is there something to be done about the giant glowing rock?~
@43429 = ~I see no benefit in standing here waiting for the crusade's next attack. I'll be going now.~
@43430 = ~I was told to seek you out. I should have been warned about your work's critical nature.~
@43431 = ~The Creeping Darkness

I should investigate the fort and find the source of the impact.

I spoke to the wizard Wynan Hess. Immediately afterward, a violent impact shook the fort. I must learn what happened.~
@43432 = ~What—what's happening...? I—uhhhh...~
@43433 = ~Wynan! Wh-what's happened to him?~
@43434 = ~It's the stone—there's an unnatural magical aura surrounding it.~
@43435 = ~It's emitting a negative energy field—sapping the strength of all around it.~
@43436 = ~Yes—I can feel it weakening me even as we speak. How can we stop it?~
@43437 = ~Edwin? Have you any insight to offer on this?~
@43438 = ~Baeloth, I believe this is your area.~
@43439 = ~Dynaheir, can you shed any light on what's going on here?~
@43440 = ~What tipped you off? Was it the glowing symbols? ~
@43441 = ~With each passing second, I feel it leeching power from my body. I must be away from it.~
@43442 = ~I have seen these sigils before... I was working on such a design for Caelar before we, er, parted company. The hand behind this magic is that snake, Vichand!~
@43443 = ~That's all well and good, but what are we going to do about it?~
@43444 = ~Perhaps the answer lies in the crusader camp. They are the ones responsible for this attack.~
@43445 = ~What do you think, Wynan?~
@43446 = ~Edwin? Any ideas?~
@43447 = ~Baeloth, I believe this is your area.~
@43448 = ~Dynaheir, can you do anything about this?~
@43449 = ~The stone is enchanted with a dark, leeching power. Left unchecked, sickness and death will spread throughout the fort. To stop it, I'll need the scroll used to enchant the rock.~
@43450 = ~With each passing second, strength seeps from my body. I must be away from this damnable rock!~
@43451 = ~The longer this is left unchecked, the worse it will get. The field will grow, in size and intensity. Soon all within this fort will be dead or dying. To stop it, we will need the original spellscroll Vichand used to enchant the rock.~
@43452 = ~The stone's sorcery will spread, striking down first the sickly, then the strong. We must seek the spellscroll that started the sequence to stymie this scheme.~ [BD43452]
@43453 = ~This is dark magic, <CHARNAME>. The stone's energy will grow, weakening the strong and striking down the weak. To save all souls in Bridgefort, we need the original enchanter's spellscroll.~ [BD43453]
@43454 = ~If the s-spell scroll is anywhere, it-it-it'll be in the crusade's camp.~
@43455 = ~The negative energy contained in the stone will spread, weakening all those in Bridgefort's walls who it doesn't kill outright. If I had the original spellcaster's scroll, I might be able to terminate the enchantment.~ [BD43455]
@43456 = ~You've got to get into the crusade camp and find that scroll. Without it, Bridgefort will surely fall.~
@43457 = ~I won't allow that to happen. You can count on me to get the scroll.~
@43458 = ~Me? Why am I always the one who has to risk <PRO_HISHER> life to save the day? Fine, I'll do it.~
@43459 = ~If the fort falls, I fall with it. It seems I have no choice.~
@43460 = ~While I will attempt to get the scroll AND stay alive. Not necessarily in that order.~ [BD43460]
@43461 = ~There's no time to waste—I can feel the stone's magic moving through my body even as we speak. Go, get the scroll—save us all.~
@43462 = ~I encountered a Red Wizard in the crusader camp. He had this scroll—could it be the one we need?~
@43463 = ~Let me see it... yes, that's it. We've taken a hit, but with this at least the damage can be minimized. Give me a moment to prepare myself and then speak with me again.~ [BD43463]
@43464 = ~Find the scroll and return to me as quickly as you can.~ [BD43464]
@43465 = ~What n-news?~ [BD43465]
@43466 = ~I have the scroll we need to end this curse on Bridgefort.~
@43467 = ~Nothing, I'm afraid. I will depart soon in an effort to find the scroll needed to disable the spellstone.~
@43468 = ~The scroll?~
@43469 = ~Nothing so far. I have much more to accomplish than your tasks.~
@43470 = ~You've s-saved us all! Quickly, bring the scroll to the st-stone!~
@43471 = ~If you c-cannot, we're doomed. P-Please make haste. We're c-counting on you.~
@43472 = ~The scroll that will l-let us cancel the neg-negative energy field afflicting everyone in the fort.~
@43473 = ~That explains why I feel so weak. Take heart, Khalid—I will find this scroll.~
@43474 = ~Oh, THAT scroll. Right. I'm on it.~
@43475 = ~Why are you still here? You're supposed to be getting the scroll from the crusaders.~ [BD43475]
@43476 = ~I'll be taking care of that shortly, I assure you.~
@43477 = ~I wanted to speak to you of a different scroll—one with a coded message on it.~
@43478 = ~The scroll?~
@43479 = ~And so I shall—when I see fit.~
@43480 = ~The scroll that will enable us to dispel the negative energy field that's slowly killing everyone in Bridgefort? Remember? ~
@43481 = ~I do now. I'll head out to find it directly.~
@43482 = ~Oh, THAT scroll. Right. I'm on it.~
@43483 = ~I do remember. I will retrieve the scroll, you can count on that. But I will do so at a time of my own choosing.~
@43484 = ~Go, then. People are dying, there's no time to waste.~
@43485 = ~The one you gave me just after the spellstone hit.~
@43486 = ~The same.~
@43487 = ~You remember. Excellent.~
@43488 = ~If it'll get you out looking for the other scroll faster, let's take a look at it. ~
@43489 = ~Here it is. ~
@43490 = ~Let me see here. Hmmm... Yes...~
@43491 = ~I can translate it, but it will take some time. Time you should use to seek out the scroll that will save everyone in this fort.~
@43492 = ~Agreed.~
@43493 = ~If I get the one scroll, you'll translate this one? All right. I'll do it.~
@43494 = ~Do not try to pressure me, mage. You'll not like the result.~
@43495 = ~People are dying, you useless knob! If you're not going to get out there and get the scroll, at the very least get away from me. Begone!~
@43496 = ~Well, get on with it, then. You may have time to chat, but I certainly don't. Begone!~
@43497 = ~Careful, <CHARNAME>. If this is the mage we seek and we don't tip our hand, I might be able to steal the scroll right out of the man's scarlet pocket.~ [BD43497]
@43498 = ~An excellent plan, milord. I must be on my way now.~
@43499 = ~It's been a while since I picked any pockets, but if you want, I can try to lift the scroll off that mage. Maybe then we can get out of this dreary camp.~ [BD43499]
@43500 = ~I'm flattered by your interest, but I'm afraid the scroll must stay with me. It's too valuable to leave my person. When the siege is over you may study it, but for now, good-bye.~ [BD43500]
@43501 = ~I suppose it will do no harm to share my brilliance with another. Take a look at the scroll but be sure to bring it back promptly. Good <DAYNIGHTALL> to you.~ [BD43501]
@43502 = ~You'll find the spellstone's scroll and bring it back here?~
@43503 = ~I will.~
@43504 = ~Yes... That's what I'll do...~
@43505 = ~I will find the scroll. What I do with it after that remains to be seen.~
@43506 = ~Well—good. Go, then. People are dying, there's no time to waste. ~
@43507 = ~What is this—?~ [BD43507]
@43508 = ~We meet again, Vichand.~ [BD43508]
@43509 = ~Odesseiron. I haven't seen you since Dragonspear when you required convincing to join the crusade. Good to see you had the sense to stay with us.~ [BD43509]
@43510 = ~You know this man, Edwin?~
@43511 = ~Oh yes. We're all loyal crusaders. I have a few questions for you.~
@43512 = ~Before you and Edwin catch up on old times, perhaps you could answer a question for me.~
@43513 = ~Crusaders? Oh no. We're here to put an end to you and to the crusade.~
@43514 = ~And now we have to be going. Excuse us.~
@43515 = ~My apologies. There's something else I'd like to ask you.~
@43516 = ~Y-yes... crusaders. (That will do for now. The cretin will never figure out the truth.)~
@43517 = ~You are disturbing my meditation. Begone. ~
@43518 = ~There will be no gold for you, betrayer—just the cold embrace of your well-deserved demise!~ [BD43518]
@43519 = ~My deepest apologies, my lord.~
@43520 = ~The Creeping Darkness

The spellstone has been deactivated, and Bridgefort is safe.

Using the attack on the crusade as cover, Wynan Hess was able to steal a copy of the needed scroll and deactivate the dangerous spellstone.~
@43521 = ~Why do you disturb my meditations?~
@43522 = ~Who are you?~
@43523 = ~Have you any magic items for sale?~
@43524 = ~I'm looking for a feather from a planetar's wing. I don't suppose you have one?~
@43525 = ~Are you the magician who designed the spellstone that's infecting the inhabitants of Bridgefort?~
@43526 = ~You are clearly a magician of great skill and power. I would like to learn from your work. Might I study the scroll you used? Perhaps I could come up with an additional spell with which to plague the defenders of the fort.~
@43527 = ~You heard about that, did you? Yes, it was an enchantment of my design. Quite effective. The fort will fall in days, if not hours. Caelar should be well-pleased with my efforts. ~ [BD43527]
@43528 = ~I need to know how to stop the stone's effects.~
@43529 = ~That is why I am not pleased with your efforts. How do I stop the stone, wizard?~
@43530 = ~Caelar's not here right now. You would be wise to focus on pleasing me. Tell me how to terminate the spellstone's effects, mage—or I'll terminate you in their stead.~
@43531 = ~You would see them stopped—? Who are you, exactly? ~
@43532 = ~I am <CHARNAME>, hero of Baldur's Gate. Now tell me how to end the spell or by the gods I'll not be responsible for what happens to you.~
@43533 = ~A friend of Bridgefort. That is all you need know.~
@43534 = ~I'm the last person you want to cross, that's who I am. Now tell me what I want to know.~
@43535 = ~Do not hurt me—please! I'll give you what you want.~
@43536 = ~You should never have come here. Now you shall die!~
@43537 = ~I do not want to hear your apologies. I want to hear nothing from you. Just go.~
@43538 = ~Edwin's Tale of Woe

We will defeat Vichand when the time is right.

I encountered the Red Wizard, Vichand, in the crusader camp. Edwin craves vengeance on the man and intends to kill him at the first opportunity. If I meet Vichand in combat, Edwin will be profoundly grateful. Or as grateful as he ever gets.~
@43539 = ~You think to threaten me, Vichand, first son of Orannias, vizier to monarchs, and master of the one true element? Then die, die like the fool you are!~ [BD43539]
@43540 = ~He was right there! That backstabbing, betraying CHARLATAN. I could have had my revenge!~ [BD43540]
@43541 = ~What are you doing here? What is it you want?~
@43542 = ~Have you any magic items for sale?~
@43543 = ~I'm looking for a feather plucked from a planetar wing. I don't suppose you have one?~
@43544 = ~I take it you had a hand in the creation of the spellstone that's draining the lives of those in Bridgefort. Give us the scroll you used to create the stone and we'll leave you in peace.~
@43545 = ~I've gotten everything I could possibly want from you. Farewell.~
@43546 = ~There is nothing we want from you, wizard. Nothing but your death.~
@43547 = ~Your end is nigh, traitor!~ [BD43547]
@43548 = ~I see. In that case, I have nothing more to ask.~
@43549 = ~You have the honor of addressing Vichand, Red Wizard of Thay, loyal servant to the Shining Lady, Caelar Argent.~
@43550 = ~And if I did? What business is that of yours?~
@43551 = ~The gold business. I'd like to purchase it.~
@43552 = ~A bloody one, if you don't give me the feather.~
@43553 = ~Show me the gold. ~
@43554 = ~Here. Take what you think it's worth.~
@43555 = ~Oh, this is embarrassing—I don't actually have any.~
@43556 = ~You insult my devotion with an offer of gold? Once there was a time I would have considered your offer, but those days are past. Give yourself to the light as I have, or suffer as all who stand against our holy cause must. Now begone!~ [BD43556]
@43557 = ~And here is your feather. Now, assuming there is nothing else I can do for you, be on your way. My work requires concentration.~ [BD43557]
@43558 = ~Have you any other items for sale?~
@43559 = ~Are you the magician who designed the spellstone that's infecting the inhabitants of Bridgefort?~
@43560 = ~You are clearly a magician of great skill and power. I assume you fashioned the spellstone currently draining the lives of those in Bridgefort? I want that stopped. Give me the scroll you used to create it, now.~
@43561 = ~No. We're done.~
@43562 = ~Then leave me. I must meditate.~
@43563 = ~Do I look like a merchant to you? I am a researcher and spellcaster, not a trader.~
@43564 = ~You threaten Vichand? Red Wizard of Thay, first son of Orannias, vizier to monarchs, disciple of the Shining Lady, and master of the one true element?~
@43565 = ~I am wholly unfamiliar with nearly all of those things.~
@43566 = ~Count yourself lucky I have better things to do than crush insects right now.~
@43567 = ~Here is the feather. Now begone, lest I change my mind and smear you 'neath my heel like the bug you are.~
@43568 = ~This is the scroll that I used to create the spellstone. Any spellcaster of even moderate skill can use it to nullify the negative energy field.~ [BD43568]
@43569 = ~I have given you what you want. Now please, just go.~
@43570 = ~You have dealt with me fairly. I will pay you the same courtesy. Farewell.~
@43571 = ~I seek a feather from a planetar wing. Do you have one, by any chance?~
@43572 = ~I trust you're not so suicidal as to try to alert the crusade to my presence once I leave your sight. I am a vengeful <PRO_MANWOMAN>, and my reach is very long.~
@43573 = ~Right after I cast a little sleep spell.~
@43574 = ~And let you alert the entire camp to my presence? Do you think me a fool?~
@43575 = ~Deceiver! I gave you what you asked for, and this is how I am repaid? Face the wrath of Vichand, first son of the County Orange!~
@43576 = ~Better to sleep than to die. Cast your spell.~
@43577 = ~Just leave me in peace and I'll be more than happy to do the same for you. Now go.~
@43578 = ~Intruder! There is an intruder in the camp! To arms, crusaders, we are under attack!~
@43579 = ~You'll forgive me if I do not bid you to fare well. In fact, I would take great pleasure in seeing you fare ill.~
@43580 = ~<CHARNAME>. P-please tell me you have the s-scroll. More and more p-people are feeling the effects of the spellstone. I do not th-think we can last much longer. ~
@43581 = ~I've got it. The crusade's craven attempt to lay you low nears its end.~
@43582 = ~I'm afraid I couldn't find it.~

@43584 = ~You're going to have to. I haven't gotten the scroll yet.~
@43585 = ~It's over. I do not have the scroll.~
@43586 = ~Thank the g-gods. Quickly, t-take it to the spellstone.~
@43587 = ~All will be well, Khalid. I swear it.~
@43588 = ~Let's not get ahead of ourselves. Even without the spellstone, there's plenty of troubles ahead.~
@43589 = ~Ah! All is lost!~
@43590 = ~Do not despair, my friend. I've not given up hope yet, and neither should you.~
@43591 = ~It will be if we don't do something immediately. Gather your people, Khalid. We're taking the battle to the crusade.~
@43592 = ~Perhaps, perhaps not. With your permission, Khalid, I'd like to try negotiating with the crusaders. Perhaps I can find a way out of this quandary.~
@43593 = ~If that is your attitude, then you truly are lost.~
@43594 = ~It's h-hard to hold onto hope when you see your p-p-people dying in front of you. But I shshall try.~
@43595 = ~I do not want my people to die—not l-l-like this. Follow m-me.~

@43597 = ~You have the scroll? ~ [BD43597]
@43598 = ~I do.~
@43599 = ~Here it is.~
@43600 = ~How much is it worth to you?~
@43601 = ~I do. Baeloth, if you'd be so kind as to negate the stone's effects?~
@43602 = ~That, and someone who knows how to use it. Edwin?~
@43603 = ~Yes. Dynaheir, could you please put an end to this dark magic once and for all.~
@43604 = ~Hand it over, then, unless you know what to do with it. ~
@43605 = ~I believe I can.~
@43606 = ~Here it is.~
@43607 = ~Slow down there. We need to talk about how much this scroll is worth first.~
@43608 = ~Do it, then. We've suffered enough.~
@43609 = ~Good. Stand back.~
@43610 = ~It is done.~
@43611 = ~More than your life, you greed-addled thickwit. Hand it over.~

@43615 = ~You would risk our lives to line your pockets?~
@43616 = ~No, of course not. Here, take it.~
@43617 = ~Less lining than filling. These are people's lives we're talking about.~
@43618 = ~I would sacrifice anyone's life if it were to my benefit.~
@43619 = ~It would be my mildly put-upon pleasure.~ [BD43619]

@43625 = ~What is that—?~ [BD43625]
@43626 = ~That noise... What is that noise?~
@43627 = ~Vichand built a defense mechanism into the spellstone for instances such as this! Canceling the leech field releases a negative energy wraith!~
@43628 = ~A dark wraith!~ [BD43628]
@43629 = ~You did right by us, <CHARNAME>. For that, I thank you.~ [BD43629]
@43630 = ~It was a privilege, sir. We're all in this together.~
@43631 = ~It was nothing. Well, not nothing, in truth it was quite a bit. But sacrifices have to be made, sometimes.~
@43632 = ~Well done, hero. With your attack on the crusaders as a distraction, I was able to find a copy of the scroll and deactivate the spellstone. We're all safe now.~
@43633 = ~Caelar wants this fort to fall. I would see it stand, just to spite her. I do not need your thanks, nor do I want them.~
@43634 = ~You're right about that. I must continue fortifying our mystical defenses. Until we cross paths again, fare well.~
@43635 = ~Eh? Oh yes, the scroll. I've been meaning to talk to Jegg about that. It says, "Kill blacksmith if not already dead. Use solvent to destroy forge. -H”.~
@43636 = ~Jegg?~
@43637 = ~So an agent of the crusade is within Bridgefort's walls. Most disturbing. I think it best we keep this between us—we don't want this spy to know we're onto them. I'll talk to the blacksmith.~
@43638 = ~Interesting. Thank you for the information, Master Hess.~
@43639 = ~Jegg Hillcarver. She's served as the fort's blacksmith since her husband was slain by the crusade. You must have seen her forge—it's right across from my chamber.~

@43641 = ~The message was intercepted by a man named Roark—it didn't reach its intended target. Mistress Hillcarver might be safe... but I think I'd better alert her to the threat regardless.~

@43643 = ~I've no stomach for this sort of chicanery, so I'll leave you to it. Farewell.~
@43644 = ~Perhaps not so interesting. The message was intercepted by Roark, was it not? So the spy never got it. All should be well.~
@43645 = ~Even so, I think I'd best speak with the blacksmith.~
@43646 = ~I hadn't thought of that. You're right, we have nothing to fear.~
@43647 = ~You are too blase. One message was intercepted; another may have reached its intended destination. Stay alert. At a minimum, we know an enemy walks among us.~

@43656 = ~Are you a cleric? ~
@43657 = ~I am.~
@43658 = ~I have healing potions.~
@43659 = ~No, but I've got the best elements of clerics in a bottle, without any of the fussy, judgmental "praise be to the gods" stuff.~

@43681 = ~That's no language. I know a code when I see one, and I'm looking at one right now. Unfortunately, it's beyond my ability to decipher.~
@43682 = ~It's not a language. It's a code, used by bards to pass bits of gossip back and forth in secret.~
@43683 = ~No. Give me the scroll; I'll try to find someone who can.~
@43684 = ~Damn it, man. I'm a <PRO_CLASS>, not a scribe!~
@43685 = ~I've no interest in reading it. I have more important things to do.~
@43686 = ~Perhaps W-wynan Hess can make s-s-s-sense of it. He's the wisest m-man in Bridgefort by a wide margin. He sh-should be in the fort's l-lower level.~

@43736 = ~The work you do is vital to Bridgefort's continued ability to defend itself.~
@43737 = ~No other man, woman, or child in these walls can do the work you do. And that work is vital if Bridgefort is to continue to stand against the crusade.~
@43738 = ~Your humility does you a disservice. You know your value is far greater than most of these sheep.~
@43739 = ~Have they indeed? Well, let them come. I'd welcome a fight with any crusader that tries to cross me. ~
@43740 = ~As would I, but we do not know who will come for you—Caelar has an agent operating within our walls.~
@43741 = ~We are of one blood. I share your feelings. But we're not talking about a fight here—we're talking about an assassination. If you don't do what I tell you, you will die.~
@43742 = ~There's a spy within these walls, an assassin whose next target is you. If we give them the chance to attack you, the odds are you won't get the chance to fight.~

@43744 = ~You think an assassin would give you a fighting chance? Are you truly so foolish?~
@43745 = ~So what would you have me do? ~
@43746 = ~The spy's been told to destroy the forge as well as you. Tell everyone you're going to get some sleep, then hide in yon room. I have a potion of invisibility. I'll wait here for the spy to make their move, then strike.~

@43749 = ~Do as you will. You know of the danger now. Forewarned is forearmed.~
@43750 = ~Aye, well. Thanks for that. Now be off with you, I've work to do.~
@43751 = ~Have a care. Those sheep are my friends.~
@43752 = ~I will do as you say. But: This was my husband's forge. He worked on it every day for nigh on two decades. You're a dwarf. You know what that means. Take care of it.~
@43753 = ~You want me to leave someone I barely know to watch over my forge? That's not going to happen.~
@43754 = ~Very well. I have another potion of invisibility. We'll watch for the spy together. My friends will hide.~
@43755 = ~Nothing's happened! This insulting lump got me worked up over some nonsense about an assassin.~
@43756 = ~Very well. You take the potion, and I'll cloak myself in shadows. We'll await the traitor together.~
@43757 = ~Damn it! This isn't just your life we're talking about—everyone in this fort is depending on you!~
@43758 = ~You are a fool. Soon you will be a dead fool.~
@43759 = ~This is a scheme I can get behind. Let's do it.~
@43760 = ~I will do as you say. But: This was my husband's forge. He worked on it every day for nigh on two decades. If anything happens to it, you'll have more to worry about than a crusade assassin. Got it? Good.~

@43770 = ~I don't believe he is. Be patient, and quiet. The spy will appear, I'm sure of it.~
@43771 = ~Will you please keep your damned mouth shut?~
@43772 = ~Be silent, you stupid cow! You're going to give us away.~
@43773 = ~Keep a civil tongue in your head or I'll have it out, you pestering neddy!~
@43774 = ~Jegg? Is that your v-voice I hear? What's h-happened to you?~
@43775 = ~Nothing's happened to me! This insulting lump got me worked up over some nonsense about an assassin.~
@43776 = ~It's nothing you need concern yourself over, Khalid. I assure you.~
@43777 = ~Well, that was a waste of a good potion of invisibility.~
@43778 = ~Well, that was a waste of two good potions of invisibility.~
@43779 = ~Nothing. She's doing nothing.~
@43780 = ~嗯。~
@43781 = ~Are you here, smith? I have some work I need done.~
@43782 = ~It's him! He's the spy, I know it!~
@43783 = ~Perhaps. Just—be silent a moment. Let us see what he does.~
@43784 = ~You are really tremendously bad at this, you know that?~
@43785 = ~Stop moving your lips or I'll cut them from you face, you hideous grotesque!~

@43789 = ~Smith? Anyone? Are you here?~
@43790 = ~Gods, woman! You nearly scared me to death! What's the meaning of this?~
@43791 = ~I believe Mistress Hillcarver is in danger.~
@43792 = ~Nothing. No meaning.~
@43793 = ~Damn it! Does your life truly mean so little to you that you'd risk it like this?~
@43794 = ~Risk her life? What? Has someone threatened you, smith?~
@43795 = ~Forgive me for saying so, but that hardly makes her unique in this place.~
@43796 = ~Aye, that's what I said. Forget this wearisome scold. What can I do for you?~
@43797 = ~Ahhh, forget this wearisome scold. What can I do for you?~
@43798 = ~As I said, I have a weapon in need of repair.~
@43799 = ~Perhaps I was wrong—perhaps there is no spy. Forgive me for taking up your time, Mistress Hillcarver.~

@43811 = ~A generous offer. I hope I never need to take you up on it, but I'll keep it in mind.~
@43812 = ~Actually, there is something you might be able to help me with. I acquired these shards from the spellstone the crusade hit us with. They clearly have magical qualities—would it be possible to incorporate them into a weapon of some sort?~

@43843 = ~Tolerably well, though it'd be better if M'Khiin's armor were finished.~
@43844 = ~The crusade tries to wear me down, but I still stand. Have you managed to make anything of those black stones I gave you?~
@43845 = ~No time for chat, Jegg. Let me see what you've got available in the way of arms.~
@43846 = ~Not so well as it was before you started talking to me.~

@43856 = ~Make it faster. I'll check in with you later.~
@43857 = ~Of course, of course. Here, take a look.~

Murs warned me that dark druids claim a territory far to the west and south of the old ogre settlement.~
@43894 = ~Accessing the Warrens

I need to find the access point to the underground caverns, north and west of here.

Murs told me I can gain entry to the caverns directly beneath Dragonspear far to the west and north of the ogres' old settlement.~

@43896 = ~Water Elemental~
@43897 = ~Nereid~
@43898 = ~There's no time to waste. We'll start for Bridgefort as soon as the camp is struck.~
@43899 = ~I'll do that.~
@43900 = ~Sounds good.~ [BD43900]
@43901 = ~And watch your back. It's possible some crusaders were left on this side of the Winding Water.~
@43902 = ~Something exploded, that's what happened. We'll need to cross the Winding Water over Boareskyr Bridge.~
@43903 = ~There's no time to waste. We'll leave as soon as the camp is struck.~
@43904 = ~I'll do that.~
@43905 = ~Sounds good.~
@43906 = ~Watch your back. It's possible some crusaders were left on this side of the Winding Water.~
@43907 = ~It's been too long since I saw him last. How is he?~
@43908 = ~Good.~
@43909 = ~I'll let him tell you himself. Follow me.~
@43910 = ~Come on, then.~
@43911 = ~I shall grieve for her when this is o-over. Until then, these people need me. But surely you had another purpose in coming here?~
@43912 = ~First I'd like to know what you're doing here.~
@43913 = ~I do. I am accompanied a Flaming Fist company from Baldur's Gate. We're here to liberate Bridgefort, then move on to Dragonspear Castle.~
@43914 = ~This place is a step on my path to annihilate Caelar Argent and her so-called "crusade."~
@43915 = ~"Who're you?" What kind of talk is that? "Who goes there?", that's what a guard says. The answer is <CHARNAME>. I'm here to help you.~
@43916 = ~The real question is how I shall leave. The answer is over the crusaders' corpses. Lower the drawbridge. We're taking the battle to the crusade.~
@43917 = ~Khalid, you can't allow this.~
@43918 = ~<CHARNAME> is right. We can wait n-no longer. The b-attle for Bridgefort starts now.~
@43919 = ~Lower the drawbridge. We're taking the battle to the crusade. Now.~
@43920 = ~Do I know you?~
@43921 = ~Half the length of a snapped longbow protrudes from the mud of the underground lake's shore, the bowstring still attached to the lower limb lying an arm's length away.~

@43923 = ~Imoen does not know when or how she acquired this belt, and despite all of her efforts and magic it cannot be removed or unbuckled.

Weight: 0~
@43924 = ~What are you still doing here? Make yourself useful—go take care of the caverns 'neath Dragonspear.~ [BD43924]
@43925 = ~I plan to. But before I do, I would know everything there is to know about Caelar.~
@43926 = ~I like to think I'm useful in a variety of ways. Not all of them require me to go underground.~
@43927 = ~I do as I will, where I will, Torsin. Do not cross me.~
@43928 = ~Intelligence collection is a continuing effort. We know she is an Argent, and that her family was held in great esteem within the Order of the Aster. It took some digging, but we've learned Caelar was raised at one of the Aster's compounds.~ [BD43928]
@43929 = ~Intriguing. Thank you.~
@43930 = ~The Order of the Aster?~
@43931 = ~The Argents were held in great esteem? But no longer?~
@43932 = ~Considering what she's accomplished, she must have learned their lessons well.~
@43933 = ~Holy warriors whose lives are pledged in service to Lathander, the Morninglord.~ [BD43933]
@43934 = ~Is she still a member of the Order of the Aster?~
@43935 = ~Ah yes. I've heard of them.~
@43936 = ~How did a soldier of the Morninglord come to claim she serves the will of all the gods?~
@43937 = ~I've encountered several of her followers. They are zealots and some are mighty warriors, but they are no paladins.~
@43938 = ~She no longer has any association with the order. As far as we can determine, there was an incident of some sort. Caelar was little more than a child at the time, but her name was struck from the Order's records and she was cast out.~ [BD43938]
@43939 = ~I'll have to ask her what happened when I face her. Thank you for the information.~
@43940 = ~Do we know anything of this incident?~
@43941 = ~So she's no friend to her former order. Do you know how she came to develop the belief system she espouses now?~
@43942 = ~Do we know what she did after she was cast out?~
@43943 = ~No. After she left the Order, she seems to have vanished. What she was up to during the intervening years is a mystery.~ [BD43943]
@43944 = ~Few seem to know what happened, and those who do are spread out across Faerûn, beyond our reach in any practical sense. We believe it's significant that an uncle of hers, Aun Argent, vanishes from the official record around the same time Caelar was cast out. Unlike his niece, the order holds Aun in the highest regard.~ [BD43944]
@43945 = ~Thanks. You've been most helpful.~
@43946 = ~Mystery piles upon mystery. Do you know what happened between her leaving the Order of the Aster and her reappearance?~
@43947 = ~So she slew her uncle...~
@43948 = ~Don't jump to conclusions. We don't know why she was expelled from the Order, nor do we know what happened between her banishing and the commencement of her crusade.~ [BD43948]
@43949 = ~I suspect it involves her advisor, the so-called "Revered Brother" Hephernaan. As you are already aware, we know little of him.~ [BD43949]
@43950 = ~Thanks. You've been very informative.~
@43951 = ~There's always a power behind the throne. We'd do well to learn more of this Hephernaan.~
@43952 = ~再和我讲讲你对凯拉的了解。~
@43953 = ~I know enough. He will share the same fate as his mistress.~
@43954 = ~Charming. I suppose I should expect no better from a representative of Baldur's Gate, a city of pirates and other criminal scum. Go, get out of here. Do your damned job!~ [BD43954]
@43955 = ~I am less concerned with Caelar's past than her future, which I hope to see abbreviated in the most efficient manner possible. Now, be about your business.~ [BD43955]
@43956 = ~Well, think nothing of it. It's not like I have a siege to run or anything. Now go. The sooner you get out of camp, the happier I'll be.~ [BD43956]
@43957 = ~That's undoubtedly true, but what that fate will be remains to be seen. Now go take care of the cavern business, before your presence here becomes disruptive.~ [BD43957]
@43958 = ~Do you think I've nothing better to do? Bloody Baldur's Gate... Fine. Pay attention this time.~ [BD43958]
@43959 = ~She's about yea tall, brown hair. Whining loudly, if I understand things correctly. You haven't seen her...? ~
@43960 = ~<CHARNAME>, good to see you.~ [BD43960]
@43961 = ~You as well, Marshal Nederlok.~
@43962 = ~I wish I could return the compliment, but I have much to do and no time to waste on idle chatter.~
@43963 = ~I beg your pardon, Marshal. I've no time to tarry.~
@43964 = ~Respect, <CHARNAME>. Try showing some.~
@43965 = ~It's all right, Captain Corwin. You have important business to take care of. Mine can wait.~
@43966 = ~I know you have important business to take care of. Good luck with it.~
@43967 = ~You know the daughter of Grand Duke Silvershield journeyed with the Flaming Fist from Baldur's Gate, yes? Do you know where I might find her?~ [BD43967]
@43968 = ~She was with us when we arrived at the camp, this much I know. What happened to her after that, I couldn't say.~
@43969 = ~Just listen for an endless stream of complaints, and you shall find her.~
@43970 = ~I don't, and that is a most agreeable situation.~
@43971 = ~I gather she's not endeared herself to you, or much of anyone in your troupe.~ [BD43971]
@43972 = ~You gather correctly.~ [BD43972]
@43973 = ~If you see her, tell her to seek me out, please. It was one thing to torment her on the journey here, but if she were killed or fell into enemy hands, Duke Silvershield would be... displeased.~ [BD43973]
@43974 = ~Yes. That would be awful.~ [BD43974]
@43975 = ~For the crusaders. Better they endure her wailing than we do.~ [BD43975]
@43976 = ~I'll leave you to your business now. Thanks.~
@43977 = ~Have a care, <CHARNAME>. Skie Silvershield can be... trying, but she has done nothing to deserve such disrespect.~ [BD43977]
@43978 = ~You are too kind, Selûnite. Too kind by far.~ [BD43978]
@43979 = ~Whatever it was, I bet she complained about it.~ [BD43979]
@43980 = ~All right, all right, here's one for you. What do you call a dead Waterdhavian Torsin? A decent start! HAW!~ [BD43980]
@43981 = ~A decent start! Hah! ~
@43982 = ~Well, look who we have here, boys. The hero of Baldur's Gate deigns to walk among us.~
@43983 = ~Good <DAYNIGHTALL> to you, General Stonehand.~
@43984 = ~General. How does this fine <DAYNIGHTALL> find you?~
@43985 = ~And now I shall walk away. Good <DAYNIGHTALL>.~
@43986 = ~Well, look who we have here. The hero of Baldur's Gate deigns to walk among us. Aren't you supposed to be spelunking in Caelar's caverns?~ [BD43986]
@43987 = ~I'm just heading out to deal with that now.~
@43988 = ~I was—I am. But before I go, tell me, what's your impression of Torsin de Lancie and Marshal Nederlok?~
@43989 = ~I'll deal with that in my own time.~
@43990 = ~Well, don't let us keep you. Go, go, go go go!~
@43991 = ~Let's go, <CHARNAME>.~ [BD43991]
@43992 = ~Sober still, I'm sad to say. Will it last?~
@43993 = ~Nederlok's good people. Won't say a word against him. De Lancie? That's another story.~ [BD43993]
@43994 = ~You don't like him, I take it.~
@43995 = ~Tell me a tale, General Stonehand.~
@43996 = ~A story I'd rather not hear at this time. Farewell.~
@43997 = ~He's a coward. I hate to say it, but there it is. We could have—we SHOULD have taken Dragonspear when we first arrived. Redblooding Caelar was out in the High Moor then, doing gods know what. The castle would've fallen faster than a house of cards.~ [BD43997]
@43998 = ~That seems like it would have been a tactically sound move.~
@43999 = ~He prevented you from taking the castle?~
@44000 = ~You and Nederlok couldn't bring him around?~
@44001 = ~This whole mess keeps getting messier because de Lancie refuses to commit to any action that carries the slightest risk. What kind of commander is that?~ [BD44001]
@44002 = ~One I'm less than comfortable serving under. Thank you, general, you've been most helpful. Farewell.~
@44003 = ~How did such a man come to be a torsin?~
@44004 = ~Not the sort you want when faced with an adversary such as Caelar. But you and Nederlok have some influence over him, surely?~
@44005 = ~One more accustomed to bureaucracy than combat.~
@44006 = ~I've heard enough. Farewell.~
@44007 = ~His father, the Earl of de Lancie, handed him his rank, same as everything else in his life. He's in over his head now, terrified of making the wrong move, so he does nothing. Which is the wrongest move that can be made.~ [BD44007]
@44008 = ~I'm here now. And I'll not stand still and wait for Caelar to act. We'll speak more of this when I return from the caverns. Farewell, General Stonehand.~
@44009 = ~Surely you and Nederlok have some influence over him?~
@44010 = ~Enough. My suspicion that de Lancie isn't worthy to lead has been confirmed. You have my thanks. Farewell, General.~
@44011 = ~He's had us sitting here twiddling our thumbs for weeks. First he wants to "thoroughly reconnoiter" the castle. Then he wants to wait for further troops. Then the Champion of Baldur's Gate has to be here before we can do anything. Now he wants to wait till you...~
@44012 = ~He's had us twiddling our thumbs for weeks. First he wants to "thoroughly reconnoiter" the castle. Then wait for further troops. Then the hero of Baldur's Gate has to be here before we can do anything. Now he wants to hold till you finish your business in the caverns.~ [BD44012]
@44013 = ~I understand. I don't like it myself, but we do what we must.~
@44014 = ~The risk averse make poor leaders. It's always easier to do nothing than something.~
@44015 = ~I'll conclude that business as quickly as possible. Then Torsin de Lancie and I will have a... frank discussion about our overall strategy.~
@44016 = ~You've got that right. Getting spanked by his nanny's the closest he's ever been to a fight.~ [BD44016]
@44017 = ~Hah! That'll be the day. Now that you've arrived, Nederlok commands a hundred and twenty mercenaries. I have less than fifty. De Lancie? He's got more than three hundred under him, and he don't want to risk a single one.~ [BD44017]
@44018 = ~Bloody hells, we've got ourselves another Torsin de Lancie.~ [BD44018]
@44019 = ~As you say. I'll leave you to your business then. Watch your back.~ [BD44019]
@44020 = ~Aye. Axes high an' all that.~
@44021 = ~It's the hero of Baldur's Gate! Pass, friend.~
@44022 = ~Well met, hero. ~
@44023 = ~Be careful if you leave camp. The woods are dangerous.~
@44024 = ~Watch your back, <PRO_SIRMAAM>. You wouldn't want the crusade getting the drop on you. ~
@44025 = ~Best stay in the camp. It's safest there. ~
@44026 = ~The crusade's up to something. I'm sure of it.~
@44027 = ~Good to see you.~
@44028 = ~Damn that Caelar. I'm freezing my nethers off out here. ~
@44029 = ~Beware the crusade. They're sneaky little buggers. And enthusiastic.~
@44030 = ~All right. Let's find Skie and get out of here.~ [BD44030]
@44031 = ~I just hope we aren't too late. If the crusade gets their hands on her, our task becomes that much harder.~
@44032 = ~Let's not rush back to the camp too soon. We may be able to learn something useful observing our enemies.~
@44033 = ~Agreed. Skie Silvershield knows too much. Caelar can't be allowed to get her.~
@44034 = ~You say that like we haven't troubles enough...~ [BD44034]
@44035 = ~We should scout the outside of the castle first—no point risking our lives trying to get in if she's skulking out here. Let's go.~
@44036 = ~I've ob-observed the crusade enough for th-this lifetime.~
@44037 = ~There is a time to watch and a time to do battle. This is one of those times.~ [BD44037]
@44038 = ~We'll see what we see, but getting Silvershield's daughter is our priority.~
@44039 = ~Agreed.~
@44040 = ~I'll decide on my own priorities.~
@44041 = ~Let's go.~
@44042 = ~Damn it, <CHARNAME>. You just can't make it easy, can you? All right, we play it your way—as usual.~
@44043 = ~There's but one way to ensure that doesn't happen—if it's not already too late.~ [BD44043]
@44044 = ~Halt! Friend or foe? ~
@44045 = ~Fear not. I am a friend.~
@44046 = ~How can I know that? We've not even met yet.~
@44047 = ~I hold in my hand the seal of Caelar Argent. What do you think?~
@44048 = ~I'm a good friend to have and a foe you really don't want.~
@44049 = ~Threats mean little to we who stand in the light of the Caelar. What business have you here?~
@44050 = ~I seek entry to Dragonspear.~
@44051 = ~I would speak with your mistress.~
@44052 = ~I was merely passing by, and will continue to do so if it's all the same to you. Farewell.~
@44053 = ~Caelar's light protects me from all evil. Begone!~
@44054 = ~None but those who walk in the Shining Lady's light may pass through here. Do you carry Caelar's seal?~
@44055 = ~I do not—not yet. I would fight under her banner—I understand her crusade welcomes new recruits?~
@44056 = ~Have no fears, my friend. I too walk in the light. I was a lost soul, bereft of hope, when she found me. She raised me up. I was transformed. Now I want nothing but to serve her in whatever fashion she sees fit.~
@44057 = ~I do. I carry it with me at all times. See it here?~
@44058 = ~Stand aside or I'll snuff your light out as surely as I will your heretic mistress's!~
@44059 = ~Let me take a closer look at that...~
@44060 = ~Forgive me, my <PRO_LADYLORD>. I did not know you were one of the faithful. Please, pass. May Caelar's light shine upon you always.~
@44061 = ~I fear nothing. I do the will of the gods. What do you want here?~
@44062 = ~I seek entry to Dragonspear.~
@44063 = ~Let me pass. I serve the Shining Lady, just as you do. Look, I carry her seal.~
@44064 = ~The will of the gods? You truly believe that nonsense?~
@44065 = ~Let me pass, or I'll give you something to fear.~
@44066 = ~Mock me if you must. When Dragonspear gives up its dead, all will see the light. Now begone!~
@44067 = ~Without the seal of Caelar, you shall not pass. Begone!~
@44068 = ~What—? Oh, <CHARNAME>, it's you. ~
@44069 = ~What is this, <CHARNAME>? What are you doing here?~ [BD44069]
@44070 = ~What are YOU doing here?~
@44071 = ~I'm looking for you. What the hells, Skie?~
@44072 = ~Wasting my time looking for you. Get back to the camp.~
@44073 = ~I'm spying on Dragonspear, watching the crusaders for weaknesses we can exploit.~ [BD44073]
@44074 = ~What have you learned?~
@44075 = ~Who told you to do that?~
@44076 = ~I don't care what you think you're doing. Get back to the camp.~
@44077 = ~But there's nothing to DO at the camp. ~ [BD44077]
@44078 = ~You do more than you know simply by being there. You are an inspiration to all the Flaming Fist. They look upon you and know what they are fighting for.~
@44079 = ~You'll be safe there, Skie. Please, just go back.~
@44080 = ~There's little to do here other than get killed needlessly and invite your father's wrath on people who don't deserve it. GO.~
@44081 = ~This is no game, Skie Silvershield. Get back to the camp before the crusaders kill you or I swear by all the gods I'll kill you myself.~
@44082 = ~You know, when my dad was my age he took his unit into a den of wyverns and killed them all so the nearby farms would be safe.~ [BD44082]
@44083 = ~They're just as boring as the Flaming Fist. All they do is work and pray. The most interesting thing I saw was them shoring up a section of wall to the west. And that was not interesting AT ALL.~ [BD44083]
@44084 = ~Well done, Skie. This is usable intelligence. Now it's time for you to return to the camp. You're too valuable an asset to risk losing.~
@44085 = ~I know you had the best intentions, Skie. But you must return to the camp now. You're not safe here.~
@44086 = ~That might actually be useful. Good work. Now you should return to the camp.~
@44087 = ~The crusade isn't here for your entertainment. Stop acting like a child and get back to the camp.~
@44088 = ~I did good...? Really? I mean, yeah, of course. I knew that would be important.~ [BD44088]
@44089 = ~They don't even know who I am.~ [BD44089]
@44090 = ~It matters not. Beauty and nobility shine from your every pore. They may not know your name or station, but they know YOU, I assure you.~
@44091 = ~They've been instructed to pretend they don't. I promise you, your absence has not gone unnoticed—rather, it is causing serious distress. You must return, so the Fist and our allies can once again focus on the enemy.~
@44092 = ~They know your type well enough. Now get back to the camp.~
@44093 = ~When my dad was my age, he was already a hero. No one thinks I can be a hero too, but they're wrong. I'm glad YOU at least see that I've got something to offer. Take care, <CHARNAME>.~ [BD44093]
@44094 = ~No one told me to do it. I'm taking the initiative.~ [BD44094]
@44095 = ~Soldiers don't take the initiative. They follow orders. Return to the camp.~
@44096 = ~Please. What really happened? Did you get a blister on your hand? Stub your toe? Did you even think to concoct a plausible rationale for your actions, or did you just abandon your post the second it occurred to you?~
@44097 = ~You're risking your life for no good reason.~
@44098 = ~I got TWO blisters. Who lives like this? ~ [BD44098]
@44099 = ~The soldiers of the Flaming Fist. Which you joined of your own free will. Please, return to the camp. People are worried about you.~
@44100 = ~You do, for the time being. Nobody asked for you to come here, Skie—you chose to do so. Now you must live with that decision. Go back to the camp, Bence is worried about you.~
@44101 = ~Blisters will be the least of your worries if the crusade gets hold of you, you self-absorbed brat. Return to the camp, now.~
@44102 = ~No good reason? I'll give you a reason—I am Skie Silvershield, not the scullery maid the Fist would have me be. I'm not supposed to peel potatoes.~ [BD44102]
@44103 = ~I'm sure they do. Come on now, back to the camp with you. Let's go.~ [BD44103]
@44104 = ~And that's why you never become a soldier. Best do as our friend says, Mistress Silvershield.~ [BD44104]
@44105 = ~The princess shies away from common labor? I'm shocked.~ [BD44105]
@44106 = ~I feel ill.~ [BD44106]
@44107 = ~Voghiln has the cure for what ails you, ho ho!~ [BD44107]
@44108 = ~I feel even more ill.~ [BD44108]
@44109 = ~I matter that much? Truly? All right. I'll go back. Thank you, <CHARNAME>.~ [BD44109]
@44110 = ~We've better things to do than watch over you, you indolent trollop. Return to the camp.~ [BD44110]
@44111 = ~Speak for yourself, <PRO_RACE>.~
@44112 = ~Surprised to see you here. I thought you'd been sent to penetrate Dragonspear from below.~ [BD44112]
@44113 = ~I'll be heading there soon.~
@44114 = ~A fool's errand. I doubt these supposed caverns even exist.~
@44115 = ~I do not jump and run at Torsin de Lancie or anyone else's command.~
@44116 = ~Some of the commanders will be more comfortable with you out of the camp than in it, but they're not so foolish as to waste your talents. There is a way into the castle beneath Dragonspear. I'm sure of it.~
@44117 = ~Best you take care of the caverns sooner than later. You don't want de Lancie seeing you.~
@44118 = ~Am I really such a terrible distraction?~
@44119 = ~Don't worry about de Lancie. I can handle him.~
@44120 = ~I don't fear Torsin de Lancie.~
@44121 = ~I'm not worried about you. When de Lancie's upset, it's his people who pay the price. Go, do what was asked of you. Don't give him an excuse to piss on good soldiers.~
@44122 = ~Glad to hear it. Don't let me keep you.~
@44123 = ~No one said you did.~
@44124 = ~Word of what happened at Boareskyr Bridge is flying through the camp, and the story changes with every telling. It won't be long before someone claims Bhaal himself appeared and shook your hand. It's making people nervous, and nervous people with weapons and magic are a bad combination.~
@44125 = ~It's making people nervous, and nervous people with weapons and magic are a bad combination, even when the people have been trained to use them.~
@44126 = ~Make yourself scarce for a while. Go to the caverns. By the time you return, the stories will have died down, I'm sure. All right?~
@44127 = ~All right. I'll do as you say.~
@44128 = ~This camp is full of trained soldiers. Flaming Fist mercenaries, members of the Waterdeep city guard. If they have a problem with me, it's no problem of mine.~
@44129 = ~You were asked to do something. I got the impression you agreed to do it. Perhaps I heard wrong. In any event, I've my own business to attend to, so I'll leave you to yours. ~
@44130 = ~<CHARNAME>. What in the hells are you doing here?~ [BD44130]
@44131 = ~Where would you have me be, Corporal Duncan?~
@44132 = ~I'll not be here long. I need some supplies before I begin searching for the caverns that supposedly got run beneath Dragonspear.~
@44133 = ~Who in the hells are you to address me in such a manner?~
@44134 = ~I'd have you be doing what you were told to do where you were told to do it—beneath Dragonspear.~ [BD44134]
@44135 = ~I require some supplies before I embark on my journey.~
@44136 = ~Right, the caverns... Forgot about that. I'll go take care of them right now.~
@44137 = ~De Lancie and the others have no authority over me. I do not jump and run at their beck and call.~
@44138 = ~You're here because the dukes thought you would help the effort. If you can't be bothered, you might as well go back to the Gate.~ [BD44138]
@44139 = ~"Hero," my ass...~ [BD44139]
@44140 = ~Well, be quick about it. The sooner this siege is over, the sooner I get back to Baldur's Gate and my family. And that can't happen soon enough.~ [BD44140]
@44141 = ~Why aren't you in the caverns underneath Dragonspear? You know, where the commanders told you to go?~ [BD44141]
@44142 = ~I require some supplies before I embark on my journey.~
@44143 = ~Where they ASKED me to go, you mean? I plan to leave shortly.~
@44144 = ~Nederlok and the others have no authority over me. I do not jump and run at their beck and call.~
@44145 = ~See that you do. The sooner the siege ends, the sooner I see my family again. And that can't happen soon enough.~ [BD44145]
@44146 = ~Aye, right. No more, no less, yet you go where you will, when you will, and I'm stuck here, thirsty and eyes dry from watching for crusaders.~
@44147 = ~Einer! Manners!~ [BD44147]

@44158 = ~For the dead who will live again!~
@44159 = ~For Caelar!~
@44160 = ~FOR VICTORY!~
@44161 = ~We are attacked! YES!~
@44162 = ~Caelar said we'd have more time!~
@44163 = ~That treacherous serpent! She lied!~
@44164 = ~Old Voghiln will see the aasimar gets a spanking, you can bet on that!~
@44165 = ~Such treachery cannot go unpunished! Boo! Where is my punishing sword?~
@44166 = ~Lies and more lies! Is there no end to them?~
@44167 = ~<CHARNAME>? You have planned for this, I assume?~
@44168 = ~The agreement is broken, and Caelar's people will pay the price!~
@44169 = ~It seems this battle was inevitable.~
@44170 = ~Best to f-finish this sooner than later, I guess.~
@44171 = ~It seems the "Shining Lady" craves chaos more than light.~
@44172 = ~Caelar's followers will learn Shar's lessons now!~
@44173 = ~Caelar contravenes her own concession? Curious. A conundrum to consider—AFTER this cockeyed conflict's conclusion.~
@44174 = ~Cringe, fools! Flee before the mystic might of Odesseiron, crusaders! ~
@44175 = ~Entar Silvershield sends his regards, crusader!~
@44176 = ~I'll cut you in half and send both parts to a different Hell!~
@44177 = ~Cut the crusaders off! Keep them fenced in!~
@44178 = ~No crusader leaves Dragonspear alive!~

@44181 = ~Crusading fools! You face the Bhaalspawn! You face your doom! ~
@44182 = ~Ashatiel has fallen! Fall back!~
@44183 = ~This can't be happening! The Shining Lady promised us divine protection...~
@44184 = ~Retreat! Retreat!~
@44185 = ~Caelar! Why have you abandoned your humble servants in their hour of need?~
@44186 = ~Ashatiel defeated? How is this possible?~
@44187 = ~We're being beaten...?~
@44188 = ~Ashatiel is defeated—only Caelar can save us now!~
@44189 = ~The hero's done it! We've got them on the run!~
@44190 = ~Crush the crusade! Death to Caelar!~
@44191 = ~Secure the camp.~
@44192 = ~Surrender or die, crusaders!~
@44193 = ~Nice work, hero. I'm starting to see why the Grand Dukes wanted you here.~ [BD44193]
@44194 = ~That was impressive, but don't think this is over yet. We still have Caelar to deal with.~
@44195 = ~Do we have access to the inner courtyard yet?~
@44196 = ~You haven't killed Caelar yet? What do I keep you people around for again?~
@44197 = ~Where is the rabid she-dog? I'll deal with her as I've dealt with everything she's thrown at me.~
@44198 = ~Soon. Catch your breath, then meet us at the inner gate to see an end to this.~ [BD44198]
@44199 = ~We believe she's in the inner courtyard. We should be able to break through the inner gate soon. Take a moment to recover, then join us there.~
@44200 = ~Working on it. Take a moment to catch your breath, then meet us there.~
@44201 = ~Careful, <CHARNAME>. You don't want to underestimate Caelar Argent.~
@44202 = ~Little things. Eliminating obstacles between you and the Shining Lady, for instance.~
@44203 = ~We'll have the inner courtyard gates down soon. Catch your breath, then meet us there to see an end to this.~ [BD44203]
@44204 = ~We've seen no sign of crusade soldiers coming back up this way. The survivors have all retreated into the castle.~
@44205 = ~I'll watch for them. Have you seen Caelar?~
@44206 = ~Keep on guarding the roof, then. Don't let it get the drop on you.~
@44207 = ~Out of my way, soldier.~
@44208 = ~She must be trapped in the basement, if she hasn't found a way to escape. Hurry, my <PRO_LADYLORD>, and find her. We'd all like to go home.~
@44209 = ~We shall find the Shining Lady and mete out justice.~ [BD44209]
@44210 = ~Caelar's going to wish she never started this crusade when we're done with her. Carry on, soldier.~
@44211 = ~Good to see you made it, hero. Caelar's pinned in the basement if she hasn't found a way to wriggle out of here. Find her and knock her shiny head off 'er shoulders, would you?~ [BD44211]
@44212 = ~I'll find her and bring an end to all this.~
@44213 = ~I would not oppose her if what she proposes were possible. It isn't. All her mad crusade does is add to the ranks of the dead.~
@44214 = ~Why don't you go finish her off?~
@44215 = ~I know what I have to do. I don't need orders from you.~
@44216 = ~We gotta figure out where all the crusaders are runnin' off to. They must be down in those tunnels. We'll stop the crusade—you take care of Caelar.~ [BD44216]
@44217 = ~Tymora be with you, hero.~
@44218 = ~I'll be with them. That is better than the fickle blessing of the gods.~ [BD44218]
@44219 = ~Get to it, then! An' we'll have a drink after all this is done.~ [BD44219]
@44220 = ~There is much you do not know about your mistress. Her light blinds as much as it bedazzles. Perhaps moreso. But I'll waste no more time on you, chimp, not while the shimmering harlot you follow still breathes. Onward!~
@44221 = ~Hahah! Free, free! Free at last!~
@44222 = ~Avernus sends its regards!~
@44223 = ~You will be swallowed by the pit! Avernus will take you all!~
@44224 = ~Rip and rend and tear and claw and rip and rip, rip, rip!~
@44225 = ~Your time is over! The Prime will fall to Avernus!~
@44226 = ~I'm gonna kill you and eat you, not necessarily in that order.~
@44227 = ~You are ours now! Die!~
@44228 = ~I'll taste your entrails, pigmortals!~
@44229 = ~Our master will bathe in your blood!~
@44230 = ~Voghiln is reminded of that tenday he went without a drink. Most unpleasant.~ [BD44230]
@44231 = ~We fight an endless army in an enclosed space, <CHARNAME>. It is only a matter of time before we are overwhelmed.~ [BD44231]
@44232 = ~We can't fight off these devils forever. What would you have us do, <CHARNAME>?~
@44233 = ~These attacks are just the beginning. We can't just stand here—we must act, or we will be slain.~
@44234 = ~We c-can't get through the vault door. Our op-options appear to be limited.~
@44235 = ~Edwin Odesseiron did not come all this way just to be killed by some infernal imp in a subterranean vault. Fix this, immediately, I command it!~
@44236 = ~Devils, devils everywhere! But especially the floor, when Minsc is done with them!~ [BD44236]
@44237 = ~Can we do something other than die stupid, here?~ [BD44237]
@44238 = ~Look, there's a way out of this vault. It's vomiting devils at the moment, but I don't see any other options for getting out of this. Do you?~ [BD44238]
@44239 = ~More! Give me every devil you've got, you gaping hellhole! They shall all fall before me!~ [BD44239]
@44240 = ~I'd really like to go someplace else.~
@44241 = ~Well, this is no fun.~ [BD44241]
@44242 = ~This is another fine mess thou hast gotten us into.~ [BD44242]
@44243 = ~How do you contend we correct this catastrophe, <CHARNAME>?~ [BD44243]
@44244 = ~Mortal meat! We'll strip your soul to the bone!~
@44245 = ~Your damnation begins now.~
@44246 = ~Coming here was your last mistake, <PRO_RACE>!~
@44247 = ~I'll pluck your heart from your body and make you watch as I eat it.~
@44248 = ~Flay the flesh from its skeleton!~
@44249 = ~Yes... precious flesh!~
@44250 = ~You've damned yourself, fool!~
@44251 = ~No escape for the damned! No escape for you!~
@44252 = ~Taste the hospitality of the premier hell!~
@44253 = ~You've entered the pit! You will never leave!~
@44254 = ~You have come far, <CHARNAME>. But Thrix the Profane's master would have you go no further... for now.~ [BD44254]
@44255 = ~Who is this master you speak of?~
@44256 = ~I'm afraid I'm on rather a tight schedule at the moment, so if you'd be so kind as to step aside, I'd really appreciate it.~
@44257 = ~You think you can stop me?~
@44258 = ~Thrix doesn't want to stop you, little <PRO_RACE>. Thrix merely wants to see what you're made of.~
@44259 = ~Fellow fiends! Attend Thrix! Tear this one apart, that he may see what it is made of!~
@44260 = ~You will meet him yourself, once he's done with the Argent. Assuming you survive that long, of course.~
@44261 = ~This is not an assumption Thrix thinks you should be making.~
@44262 = ~You mock Thrix the Profane?~
@44263 = ~I just want to go through the door. Is that all right?~
@44264 = ~A little.~
@44265 = ~I'll do worse than that, before this day is done.~
@44266 = ~No, it's not all right! Thrix just told you that!~
@44267 = ~Fellow fiends! Rip this jester apart. The joke is on you, <PRO_RACE>. Thrix will have the last laugh.~
@44268 = ~Set into the basalt walls are doors of iron, molded in the visage of a damned soul. To look upon the door is to catch a fleeting glimpse of the horror Avernus offers all who find themselves lost within it.~
@44269 = ~The screams of the damned are muted within the Basalt Tower, but the maggot stench of the place nearly overwhelms you. With every breath, it slithers into your body, its barbed tendrils raking your lungs.~
@44270 = ~In the center of the Basalt Tower, an iron lattice hangs over a shadowy abyss. Four massive chains at the corners of the grate lead upwards into a darkness above as ominous, or moreso, than the one below. ~
@44271 = ~Welcome back. ~
@44272 = ~It is good to see you again, my friend. It is good to see anything other than bloody little devils, now that Voghiln thinks of it. ~
@44273 = ~You made it out of one of the Nine Hells and sealed the portal behind you. You are full of surprises, abban. ~
@44274 = ~You are returned. Selûne be praised!~
@44275 = ~Enough with the praising of Selûne, PLEASE. This man was worse than one of those Mystra's Witnesses.~
@44276 = ~It's about time you got back. These chimp crusaders' babble was wearing on me. ~
@44277 = ~You're back! Minsc and Boo are here! We are trapped in a vault beneath a haunted castle! Everything is as it should be. ~
@44278 = ~It is good to see thee again. I had begun to fear thou wouldst not return. ~
@44279 = ~The crusaders didn't make it. ~
@44280 = ~Some days, it just doesn't pay to be a Wild Mage, you know? ~
@44281 = ~You made it back. I'd be impressed if I hadn't made it back first, and dragging these lumpy crusaders along with me besides.~
@44282 = ~What'd I miss? Tell me everything. No, wait—get the vault opened, THEN tell me everything. ~
@44283 = ~Not much of an entrance, <CHARNAME>, but I'm happy yon hatch into Hell no longer hurls hellions.~
@44284 = ~I kept the crusaders alive. Shouldn't've bothered.~
@44285 = ~It is done, then? Good. ~
@44286 = ~You're al-alive! That's f-f-fffantastic! ~
@44287 = ~The witch Minsc swore to protect...?~
@44288 = ~I'm sorry, Minsc. Dynaheir didn't make it.~
@44289 = ~She is lost to the pit now. Don't blame yourself for this, Minsc. It's not what Dynaheir would want.~
@44290 = ~Dead.~
@44291 = ~Ah! I have failed! The gods have taken my witch and my purpose with her! Damn me! Damn me for ever leaving her side! ~
@44292 = ~Don't do this to yourself, my friend. Dynaheir knew the risks of going down into Avernus. She accepted them. You mustn't blame yourself—it's not what she would want.~
@44293 = ~You didn't see as much of Avernus as I did. If you had, you'd not be damning yourself.~
@44294 = ~You did what was required of you. None can ask more.~
@44295 = ~She would not want to be dead, either. But... Minsc will try to do as you say.~
@44296 = ~So easy to say, <CHARNAME>. So hard to believe. But—Minsc will try.~
@44297 = ~Make your jokes another time, <CHARNAME>. Not here, not now. The wound is too fresh. Will it ever heal? Only Boo knows. And he tells me only that this is the time to mourn my loss.~
@44298 = ~<CHARNAME>—wh-wh-where is J-jah-jaheira? ~
@44299 = ~She fought valiantly to the end, my friend. I am truly sorry, Khalid. She didn't make it.~
@44300 = ~You should not be here, <CHARNAME>. The hero of Baldur's Gate should not risk himself so recklessly.~
@44301 = ~Dead.~
@44302 = ~My love! No! What have I done? What have I done? ~
@44303 = ~You can't hold yourself responsible for this, Khalid. Jaheira knew the risks and accepted them, even as you did. Do not mourn her loss. Celebrate her life.~
@44304 = ~Don't do this to yourself, Khalid. Don't give in, not now, not after everything you've endured.~
@44305 = ~You did what was required of you, Khalid. She would be proud.~
@44306 = ~A c-c-cold comfort, but I'll take wh-what comfort I can, right now.~
@44307 = ~There is m-much there to cele-celebrate. That is wh-what she would w-w-want. Would that I had the, the strength to do as she wished. I don't! I don't! ~
@44308 = ~My love is lost. There is no light left in my life. And y-yet, I must go on living, t-till we meet again.~
@44309 = ~I do not see Khalid among you. ~
@44310 = ~He fought valiantly to the end, Jaheira. I'm so sorry. He didn't make it.~
@44311 = ~He is lost to the pit now.~
@44312 = ~You'd be seeing ghosts if you did.~
@44313 = ~I feared this day would come. Khalid knew the risks of the life we chose—we both did. My heart is heavy with loss, but I'll not bow to my grief.~
@44314 = ~I do not see Minsc amongst thee. ~
@44315 = ~Your friend fought valiantly to the end, Dynaheir. But in the end, he fell, as all men one day do. I think he would be proud—happy, even—to have died in pursuit of justice.~
@44316 = ~He was a good and noble man. He will be missed.~
@44317 = ~I'd be disturbed if you did. He's dead.~
@44318 = ~Oh, my dear, dear friend! Thy life was hard. I hope thou hast found the peace thou so deserved at last.~
@44319 = ~This is how thou tellest me my friend Minsc is dead? Thy heart is naught but a fist of ice. Say no more. Leave me to my grief.~
@44320 = ~You know what I've got to do, <CHARNAME>.~ [BD44320]
@44321 = ~In the name of the Council of Four, you are under arrest for the murder of Skie Silvershield. You will return to Baldur's Gate to be tried for your crime.~ [BD44321]
@44322 = ~You and I have had our issues, Corporal Duncan, but you cannot believe I did this thing—can you?~
@44323 = ~This isn't what it appears to be. I don't know what's going on, but I didn't do this. I couldn't have.~
@44324 = ~I've slain hundreds—thousands!—of people on the dukes' behalf. They never had a problem with it before.~
@44325 = ~You never slew one of their children before!~ [BD44325]
@44326 = ~I didn't kill Skie—I COULDN'T have...~
@44327 = ~And I haven't started slaying them now! Stop for a moment and think, Duncan—what possible reason could I have for committing such a crime?~
@44328 = ~And so the Council's hypocrisy is exposed.~
@44329 = ~I wish I could believe that.~ [BD44329]
@44330 = ~Don't make this harder than it needs to be, <CHARNAME>. Please.~ [BD44330]
@44331 = ~The Grand Dukes do what they can to better the lives of their people, but they are human still. There's no hypocrisy in wanting retribution for the death of one's child.~ [BD44331]
@44332 = ~Come along, <CHARNAME>.~ [BD44332]
@44333 = ~Why did you do it? Why did you turn?~
@44334 = ~Shame! Shame on you and all who called you hero!~
@44335 = ~MURDERER!~
@44336 = ~Skie Silvershield will be avenged!~
@44337 = ~You're no better than Sarevok!~
@44338 = ~Die, you fiend, die! We don't need another Sarevok!~
@44339 = ~Death to the traitor! Death to the false hero!~
@44340 = ~You're going to hang, monster! You're going to hang!~
@44341 = ~May the gods have mercy on your wretched soul!~
@44342 = ~No mercy for Silvershield's slayer!~
@44343 = ~None shall mourn your passing, fiend!~
