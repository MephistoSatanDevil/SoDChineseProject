@32772 = ~我想我不知道你在说什么。~
@32773 = ~你要为你的背信弃义付出血的代价，Rieltar!~
@32774 = ~我很遗憾。我希望你能理智对待。~

@32776 = ~You will be pleased to know that Tranzig has been dealt with.~
@32777 = ~By Tempus, can it be! To be freed by those who put an end to that fiend. A triumphant day, indeed!~
@32778 = ~Why the hurry, Tranzig? You delay the inevitable.~
@32779 = ~What? Who do ya think ya are, woman?~
@32780 = ~Is it so commonplace for you to turn others to stone, mage?~
@32781 = ~YOU. How did you—~
@32782 = ~I said I would see you dead before I see the shores of the Isles once more, coward, and in Tempus's name I shall! Prepare yourself!~
@32783 = ~You shall get no quarter from us, fiend! In Tempus's name I will strike you down!~
@32784 = ~I have waited a long time for this moment, Tazok.~
@32785 = ~Huh? Who you?~
@32786 = ~You killed my wife.~
@32787 = ~Eh, I kill many. What was her name?~
@32788 = ~You do not even remember her name? You tortured her, and laughed as life left her beautiful grey eyes!~
@32789 = ~Ahh... I remember now. You look not so good without the cuts and bruises, I think! Come back for more?~
@32790 = ~I've come back to avenge my Deheriana, beast, that her spirit may rest in peace!~
@32791 = ~Hah! Good luck, puny elf! Perhaps you will be seeing your precious wife soon!~
@32792 = ~FOR DEHERIANA!~
@32793 = ~Flee then, but do not think this is over, Tazok! I WILL have my revenge!~
@32794 = ~Kivan and Tazok
Not only was Kivan unable to avenge his wife, but Tazok did not seem too bothered about the attempt, and instead complimented our fighting and allowed us to stay in the bandit camp.~
@32795 = ~Kivan's bandit hunt
Kivan's wife was tortured and killed by the beast Tazok. He'd been plotting his revenge this entire time. Not only was he unsuccessful but Tazok did not seem too bothered about the attempt, and instead complimented our fighting and allowed us to stay in the bandit camp.~
@32796 = ~It is done. Deheriana, amin liy, esta aul i' haly en' Arvandor. May you find peace... and I find acceptance.~
@32797 = ~We have met—and fought—the beast already. He escaped, but surely shall not again.~
@32798 = ~Good. I am glad he evaded death a little longer... I look forward to watching the life drain from his eyes. Slowly.~
@32799 = ~I also found this vial of liquid on one of the kobolds in the mines. I think it might have something to do with the iron.~
@32800 = ~Hmm, I'm no master of metals, but you might want to show that to Thunderhammer, up in Beregost. He might know a little more.~
@32801 = ~Again, thank you for all you've done.~
@32802 = ~Vial of Mysterious Liquid~
@32803 = ~Vial of Mysterious Liquid
Berrun Ghastkill suggested I take the vial to Taerom Fuiruim in Beregost. He'll likely know what to do with it.~
@32804 = ~I've just come from Nashkel. I found this vial on one of the kobolds lurking in the mines; I think it might be what's causing the iron to break.~
@32805 = ~You found it, just like that? Well, that certainly does 'illuminate' things, doesn't it?~
@32806 = ~I thought maybe you could use it to find a way to reverse the effects?~
@32807 = ~I couldn't, no. But I know someone who can. Give me a few days, and I should have some results.~
@32808 = ~Vial of Mysterious Liquid
I should return to Thunderhammer Smithy in a couple of days to see if Taerom has found a way to reverse the effects of the kobolds' poison.~
@32809 = ~Ah, <CHARNAME>, there you are! We found a way to counteract the contaminant, and I've tested it out on my stock. Once we're certain it works I'll send our results down to Nashkel, but in the mean-time go ahead and take a look at what I've got; I think you'll find it's a bit better than it was before.~
@32810 = ~Vial of Mysterious Liquid
Taerom has found a way to reverse the effects of the kobolds' poison. He's now selling weapons that won't break, which should help the Sword Coast return to normal, however slowly.~

@32824 = ~I could do no less. <CHARNAME>?~
@32825 = ~No! <CHARNAME>, you cannot ask this of me. I will not!~
@32826 = ~Then you will share in their fate!~
@32827 = ~There must be a way to solve this without bloodshed.~
@32828 = ~Very well. Aldeth, my hands are tied.~
@32829 = ~So be it. These trespassers may leave; but I warn you now, these are my protected lands. If you further disturb the balance, the repercussions will be severe. Consider yourself warned.~
@32830 = ~You will not consider staying, Jaheira?~

@32837 = ~You will pay for everything you have done!~
@32838 = ~Aye… Aye you’re right of course. Violence solves only the simplest problems. You must think your way through the tough ones… Thank you, <CHARNAME>. Thank you for stoppin' me. ~

@32840 = ~We need him alive, Branwen. If you are indeed indebted to me, you will cease your attack.~

@32842 = ~I am asking you, Jaheira.~
@32843 = ~I cannot, <CHARNAME>. If you go through with this, it will be without me.~

@32845 = ~Then so be it.~
@32846 = ~Skie! Whom are you skulking around with?~
@32847 = ~Father, please. It's okay. They are friends.~
@32848 = ~Friends? I only see your brother's murderers. I put my trust in you, a mistake I shan't make twice. Why have you come here? To gloat? Do you seek forgiveness? You shall enjoy neither. Get you and your so-called friends gone, Skie, or I'll have them removed permanently.~
@32849 = ~Friends? I should hope not. I see that boy you've been sneaking about with is in present company. Strange that he is back in Baldur's Gate.~
@32850 = ~Don't think for a moment, dear Skie, that I do not know what you get up to - I will not have it! This commoner does not have a hint of breeding in him. Why do you insist on putting me through this unending hardship? Our lives are difficult enough without your indelicacies. Now, please, remove them from our home or I'll have the guards do it.~
@32851 = ~But father—~
@32852 = ~I'll NOT hear another word. I'll see you at supper, we have important guests coming. Now that you are of marriageable age, we need to find you an appropriate husband. Not that he'll know what he's in for, but there you have it. With that I will take my leave. Skie, I expect them gone.~
@32853 = ~So it's true?~
@32854 = ~Skie? But—You're okay! Praise be. Your father was so worr—Oh, no. I'm so very sorry, Skie. I truly am. Come here, darling, let me take you to your family. They would very much want to see you.~
@32855 = ~Yes—No. I mean... No. I am sorry for what happened to father but I'm with Eldoth now. I can't just—Sorry, I must go.~
@32856 = ~Come along, Skie. I'm sorry about your old man.~
@32857 = ~What the hell are you thinking? This is my home. Guards! Over here!~

(Conjuration/Summoning)
Level: 1
Range: 0
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None
This spell enables the Beast Master to attempt to summon a familiar to act as <PRO_HISHER> aide and companion. Familiars are typically small creatures. A creature acting as a familiar can benefit its master, conveying its sensory powers to <PRO_HIMHER>, conversing with <PRO_HIMHER>, and serving as a guard/scout/spy as well. A Beast Master can have only one familiar at a time, and <PRO_HESHE> has no control over what sort of creature answers the summoning, if any come at all.
Note: This spell can only be cast by the protagonist.
The creature is always more intelligent than others of its type (typically by 2 or 3 Intelligence points), and its bond with the Beast Master confers upon it an exceptionally long life. The Beast Master has an empathic link with the familiar and can issue it mental commands. The Beast Master receives half the familiar's total Hit Points (rounded down) as bonus Hit Points. However, the Beast Master must take care to treat <PRO_HISHER> familiar well, for if the familiar should die, the Beast Master loses the bonus Hit Points and the familiar's Hit Points again as damage. Also, when a familiar dies, the Beast Master loses 1 point of Constitution PERMANENTLY.
Example: A Beast Master has 13 Hit Points and casts Find Familiar. The fairy dragon summoned has 12 Hit Points, so the Beast Master gets a bonus of 6 Hit Points. The Beast Master now has 19 Hit Points. If the familiar dies, the Beast Master loses those 6 Hit Points (putting <PRO_HIMHER> back at 13), loses 1 point of Constitution permanently (which may cause additional Hit Point loss), and takes 12 damage.
Here is a list of the familiars that the Beast Master receives according to alignment:
LAWFUL GOOD, NEUTRAL GOOD: Pseudo Dragon
– Hit Points: 12
– Armor Class: 0
