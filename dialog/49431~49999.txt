If I take the Red Wizard's scroll to Bridgefort, I may be able to use it to eliminate the spellstone's lifedraining effects.~
@49445 = ~The Creeping Darkness

I should bring this scroll into Bridgefort and see if anyone can decipher it.

I encountered a Red Wizard of Thay in the crusade camp. I had little choice but to kill him. He had a strange scroll on his person. Perhaps someone at Bridgefort can decipher it for me?~
@49446 = ~Edwin's Tale of Woe

I helped Edwin slay the Red Wizard Vichand and avenge his comrade.~

I encountered a Red Wizard of Thay in the crusade camp. He had the feather from a planetar wing that Neera needs to resolve her issues.~
@49448 = ~The Creeping Darkness

I must bring this scroll to Wynan Hess within Bridgefort, and quickly.

I encountered a Red Wizard of Thay in the crusade camp. He had the scroll that's needed to stop the spellstone in Bridgefort from killing everyone there. Now I have it.~
@49449 = ~Edwin's Tale of Woe

Edwin's enemy, the Red Wizard Vichand, is dead.

I encountered a Red Wizard of Thay in the crusade camp. He was once a traveling companion of Edwin's, but the two became ferocious enemies. I helped Edwin slay the Red Wizard and avenge a fallen comrade.~

Bridgefort's wizard, Wynan Hess, could not prevent a crusade attack. Now an enchanted rock is slowly killing everyone in the fort, myself included. If I cannot find the scroll to reverse the enchantment, it would be wise to leave this place soon. The scroll should be somewhere in the crusader camp, probably in the hands of a wizard.~
@49452 = ~The Creeping Darkness

I must enter the crusader camp and find the scroll used to create this enchanted spellstone.

I spoke to Bridgefort's primary spellcaster, Wynan Hess. Unfortunately, doing so distracted him long enough for the crusade to launch an attack. Now I must find a spell scroll in the crusade camp, or Bridgefort will surely fall. The scroll can likely be found with a wizard.~

@49675 = ~Pshaw. Ain't no great thing, meetin' someone like me. Still 'n all, I'm pleased t'make your acquaintance. Now if you'll excuse me, I've got some work t'do. ~
@49676 = ~What sort of work do you do, Hoach?~
@49677 = ~Don't we all.~
@49678 = ~We'll leave you to it.~
@49679 = ~He's one of the greatest cobblers this side of Waterdeep. How have you been, Uncle? Mum's worried about you.~ [BD49679]
@49680 = ~Aw, y'r mother just like t'worry, that's all. I'm stuck in this fort 'n all, but there's plenty got it worse than me. I'm fine. You tell y'r mother that, when ya get the chance.~
@49681 = ~How've you been, uncle? Mum's been worrying herself sick about you.~ [BD49681]
@49682 = ~I'll do that, Uncle Hoach. And I'll come back and talk to you again soon, if I get the chance.~ [BD49682]
@49683 = ~I'll make it quick. How have you been, uncle? Mum hasn't heard from you in a while. She's worried sick.~ [BD49683]
@49684 = ~I'll come back and talk to you again soon, all right?~ [BD49684]
@49685 = ~Ah-ya. Don't see why not. You take care now. Crusaders, don'tcha know.~
@49686 = ~He's one of the greatest cobblers this side of Waterdeep.~ [BD49686]
@49687 = ~And what is one of the greatest cobblers this side of Waterdeep doing trapped in Bridgefort?~
@49688 = ~Really? Tell me, Hoach, can you do anything with these boots?~
@49689 = ~Fascinating. Truly. But we should be going now.~
@49690 = ~Same's everyone else in here: survivin'. ~
@49691 = ~Sure I could do somethin' to 'em. Reckon ya'll want me t'make 'em better, though. That's a whole other kettle o' fish. Let's take a look at 'em.~
@49692 = ~Ain't a lot t'work with, is there? But I can make somethin' of'm. Leave'm with me, come back in a day, I'll have you up 'n runnin'.~ [BD49692]
@49693 = ~Excellent. How does 100 gold as payment sound to you?~
@49694 = ~How much will this cost?~
@49695 = ~I'd like to consider this a time before I make my decision.~
@49696 = ~Fer a friend o' my nephew? 140 gold. ~
@49697 = ~I'm afraid I don't have that much.~
@49698 = ~Done.~
@49699 = ~You're joking.~
@49700 = ~When ya do, I'll be here. Till then, here's y'r boots back. Take care.~
@49701 = ~I like a laugh as much as the next fella, but I don't joke about boots. When ye're ready t'get serious about yer feet, ya know where t'find me.~
@49702 = ~Sounds like about 50 gold less'n the job's worth. But ye're a friend o' my nephew, so it'll do. Come back t'morrow; I'll have yer boots ready by then.~
@49703 = ~Come back t'morrow. I'll have 'em ready for ya then. Till then, take care o' yerself.~
@49704 = ~Ah-ya. What can I do for ya? ~
@49705 = ~You can tell me your name, to begin with. I am <CHARNAME>.~
@49706 = ~Hard to say. What do you do for everyone else?~
@49707 = ~Nothing I'd care for.~
@49708 = ~Ah-ya. Reckon y'are at that. Name's Hoach Randymonk. Cobbler by trade, but trade's been sufferin' a bit of late. ~
@49709 = ~A cobbler, you say? Is there anything you can do with these boots?~
@49710 = ~围攻的确倾向于负面影响商业。~
@49711 = ~What do you want? You're wasting my time.~
@49712 = ~Reckon they do at that. 'S there anything I c'n do f'r ya?~
@49713 = ~Maybe. Can you do something with these boots?~
@49714 = ~Nothing springs to mind. I'll leave you to your work.~
@49715 = ~I doubt it highly. I'll be going now.~
@49716 = ~Ya may be right about that. I'll letcha be on y'r way, then. Take care.~
@49717 = ~If ya don't got somethin' f'r me t'do, I reckon that'd be for the best. Take care.~
@49718 = ~Sounds like a plan. Not much of a plan, but not much of a plan's still better'n no plan at all. Take care.~
@49719 = ~Little o' this, little o' that. Make a fair number o' boots, an' fix a fair number more, which makes sense, on account of me bein' a cobbler and all.~
@49720 = ~Very interesting. If I find my footwear in need of repair, I'll be in touch.~
@49721 = ~A cobbler, you say? Is there anything you can do with these boots I found?~
@49722 = ~This is a waste of time.~
@49723 = ~Sure I could do somethin' to 'em. Reckon ya'll want me t'make 'em better, though. That's a whole other kettle o' fish. Let's take a look at 'em.~ [BD49723]

@49726 = ~How much will this cost?~
@49727 = ~I'd like to consider this a time before I make my decision.~
@49728 = ~Fer you? Same as everyone else. 150 gold.~
@49729 = ~I'm afraid I don't have that much.~
@49730 = ~Done.~
@49731 = ~You're joking.~
@49732 = ~When ya do, I'll be here. Till then, here's y'r boots back. Take care.~
@49733 = ~I like a laugh as much as the next fella, but I don't joke about boots. When yer ready t'get serious about yer feet, ya know where t'find me.~
@49734 = ~Sounds like about 50 gold less'n the job's worth. But I like ya well enough, so it'll do. Come back t'morrow, I'll have yer boots ready by then.~
@49735 = ~200 would sound better.~
@49736 = ~I don't have that much.~
@49737 = ~200 it is.~
@49738 = ~You must be joking.~
@49739 = ~Come back t'morrow. I'll have 'em ready for ya then. Till then, take care o' yerself. ~
@49740 = ~Ah-ya? What can I do f'r ya? ~
@49741 = ~I wanted to see how my boots were coming.~
@49742 = ~I thought Glint might want to speak with you.~
@49743 = ~How does this <DAYNIGHTALL> find you, sir?~
@49744 = ~I was wondering what you know of the crusade, and the woman who leads it.~
@49745 = ~Nothing. There is nothing you can do for me, nothing I would ever desire, at any rate.~
@49746 = ~Said it'd take a day. It's been a day. Here's y'r boots.~
@49747 = ~Said it'd take a day. It been a day yet?~
@49748 = ~Not yet. I thought I'd check in regardless, in case you were ahead of schedule.~
@49749 = ~Yes. It's been at least a day.~
@49750 = ~I want my boots, damn it.~
@49751 = ~Welllll... I'm not. Come see me when I said ya should.~
@49752 = ~Ya can't fool a fool. 'Tain't been a day yet. If it had been, boots'd be done. Boots aren't done—it ain't been a day. Come back when it's been a day, 'n yer boots'll be ready.~
@49753 = ~Ah-ya? Well, I want to sprout wings 'n fly to Selûne. If I had t' guess, you'll get yer boots first. But ya won't get 'em sooner'n I promised 'em. Come back when a day's passed, an' I'll have 'em ready for ya.~
@49754 = ~Y'got somethin' ya want to say t'me, son?~
@49755 = ~Mum's terribly worried about you, Hoach. When this is done, you need to send word to Baldur's Gate that you're all right.~ [BD49755]
@49756 = ~Reckon I c'n do that. Assumin' we get out o' this place alive, which, I'll be honest, is not somethin' I'm inclined to assume at this point m'self.~
@49757 = ~You will survive this, Hoach Randymonk. I swear it.~
@49758 = ~All things considered, that seems a wise assumption not to make.~
@49759 = ~Assume nothing. The only route to success is to determine your desired outcome and act to achieve it with neither hesitation nor regret.~
@49760 = ~Caelar? Never met her m'self. They say she has a way with people. As fer the crusade, well, it's outside these walls and I'm in 'em. All things considered that seems the best. Don't know much about 'em, truth be told.~
@49761 = ~Now if ya'll excuse me, I've got work needs doin'. Take care.~
@49762 = ~I would say I'm somewhere in the area of fair t'middlin'. There's those got it worse than me, sure enough.~
@49763 = ~There's somethin' to whatcha say. Never been much fer determinin' outcomes, m'self. Maybe I'll try it sometime. Now if ya'll excuse me, I've got work needs doin'. Take care.~
@49764 = ~I'll be holdin' you to that, hero.~
@49765 = ~You take care of yourself too, Uncle Hoach. Don't make me bring bad news to Mum. You know how she takes that sort of thing.~ [BD49765]
@49766 = ~Ah-ya. Seen her kill many a messenger in my time. I'll do what I can t'not make you one of 'em.~
@49767 = ~I was doing quite well prior to all this, you know. I'd actually put a fair amount of money towards building a shrine to Baravar.~ [BD49767]
@49768 = ~Interestin'. But maybe you should go now, otherwise we'll have nothin' t'talk about next time. Take care.~
@49769 = ~So how were yer boots? Work out all right for ya? Comfortable?~ [BD49769]
@49770 = ~Very. Fantastic work, Master Randymonk.~
@49771 = ~They seemed comfortable enough—right up until I put them on and they nearly killed me.~
@49772 = ~Comfortable? The damnable things could have killed someone, you pint-sized maniac!~
@49773 = ~I haven't tried them yet. I'm sure they'll be fine.~
@49774 = ~They are satisfactory.~
@49775 = ~That name, it makes me... uncomfortable.~ [BD49775]
@49776 = ~Ah-ya. They'll work out just fine. Still... might want t'try 'em out, just t'be on the safe side. Take care now.~
@49777 = ~Glad they worked out fer ya. Well, back to the grindstone f'r me. Take care.~
@49778 = ~Nearly killed's better'n actually killed. Coulda been worse.~
@49779 = ~True enough. Funny way to die, though, surrounded by enemies but killed by one's own footwear.~
@49780 = ~I want my money back, you leaking sack of donkey dung!~
@49781 = ~I'll give you one chance and one chance only. Return my money, you deranged loon.~
@49782 = ~I wanna have a fishtail an' lure sailors to their doom with my enchantin' song. Can't always get what ya want. Take care.~ [BD49782]
@49783 = ~There's no call for insults, <CHARNAME>.~ [BD49783]
@49784 = ~Wellll... Seein' as ye're a friend o' my nephew, I s'pose a refund isn't completely out of order. Here y'go. Take care now.~
@49785 = ~I s'pose a refund isn't completely out of order. Here's yer money. Be off with ya now.~
@49786 = ~It's my money now. Be off with ya. Yer face is buggin' me.~
@49787 = ~That would be hilarious—if it happened to anyone else.~ [BD49787]
@49788 = ~Like the man said, sometimes ya kick, sometimes ya get kicked. Sorry the boots didn't work out. Stay safe—safe as ya can.~
@49789 = ~Make sure you do the same, Uncle Hoach. I don't want to have to tell Mum something happened to you.~ [BD49789]
@49790 = ~I've had it, Sempek. I've had it!~
@49791 = ~Just let it go, Damius. It's not worth it.~
@49792 = ~I tell you, if that gnome says one more word to me, ONE WORD, it'll be the last one he ever utters again!~
@49793 = ~Good <DAYNIGHTALL> to you. I am Sempek of the Daggerford militia. This is Damius. Join us, have a drink. ~
@49794 = ~Well met, Sempek, Damius. I'd like nothing better than to join you, but unfortunately I have things to attend to.~
@49795 = ~Sounds good to me.~
@49796 = ~I'll not waste my time on you.~
@49797 = ~See? You see? Another bloody gnome—they're all the same.~
@49798 = ~You're having trouble with a gnome in the Daggerford militia? His name's not Pritchard, is it?~ [BD49798]
@49799 = ~Just try and ignore Damius, <PRO_SIRMAAM>. He's not as bad with gnomes as he sounds, he's just having some difficulty right now.~
@49800 = ~It sounds better than good to mighty Voghiln, ho ho! A powerful thirst is upon me. Pass the wineskin, unless you have a cask hidden somewhere. If you do, pass them both.~ [BD49800]
@49801 = ~Things more important than having a drink? We need to have a little chat about your priorities.~ [BD49801]
@49802 = ~As you wish. It's no skin off my arse. More for us to drink, eh, Damius? Pass me that wineskin.~
@49803 = ~Aye, that's the one. Pritchard Gardnerson.~
@49804 = ~GardnersonSON. Long story.~ [BD49804]
@49805 = ~It's gonna get a lot shorter if some bloody gnomes don't shut their bloody mouths and stop acting like they're running Stonehand's show.~
@49806 = ~Do you know where we can find this Gardnersonson?~
@49807 = ~Let's get out of here, Glint. I'm thinking these men are no friends of the family Gardnersonson.~
@49808 = ~I've heard enough. We'll be going now.~
@49809 = ~You're probably right about that, but before we go, I need to ask, kind sirs: Where can I find this Gardnersonson?~ [BD49809]
@49810 = ~Last I heard, he was badgering Stonehand about strategy, like he knows something about it. Find her and you'll find him. Or at least pieces of him. Stonehand's not known for her patience.~
@49811 = ~So listen—you look like you've seen your share of violence. And you're still alive and in reasonably good shape by the looks of you, so I'm guessing you're pretty good at the whole killing of others thing. Am I right?~
@49812 = ~I kill when I must, and I take little joy from it. I mislike the direction this conversation is taking. I'll be leaving now.~
@49813 = ~Why do you ask?~
@49814 = ~Who do you want killed, and how much are you offering?~
@49815 = ~There's a gnome in our contingent—we're from Daggerford—named Gardnerson. ~
@49816 = ~You mean Glint?~
@49817 = ~Go on.~
@49818 = ~I don't like where this conversation is going. Let's stop talking now.~
@49819 = ~You want this Gardnerson killed? I can do that—if the price is right.~
@49820 = ~What? No. His name's Pritchard. Pompous jackass, he thinks he's better than the rest of us. He thinks he's in command here. Well, second in command, after General Stonehand.~
@49821 = ~His name's Pritchard. Pompous jackass, he thinks he's better than the rest of us. He THINKS he's in command here. Well, second in command, after General Stonehand. ~
@49822 = ~He needs to be taught a lesson, and I'm thinking you might be the <PRO_MANWOMAN> to do it. What do you say? Interested?~
@49823 = ~In murdering one who fights against Caelar? No. I am quite definitely not interested. ~
@49824 = ~I might be.~
@49825 = ~I can kill this Gardnerson for you. What will you give me in exchange?~
@49826 = ~I came upon a crusader a couple days ago who was carrying some interesting potions—one of fire giant strength, the other of fortitude. I was saving them for the final assault on Dragonspear, but I'll gladly part with them if it gets Gardnerson out of my hair. ~
@49827 = ~You plot to murder one of your own and expect me to help you? No, no, I'll not countenance such a thing. Not now, not ever.~
@49828 = ~I've killed for less than that. We have a deal.~
@49829 = ~Consider it done.~
@49830 = ~Bloody hells, Damius. Now you've done it. Let's get out of here quick, before <PRO_HESHE> tells anyone!~
@49831 = ~I'm sorry to hear that. Not as sorry as you're gonna be, though. Die!~
@49832 = ~Glad to hear it. Last I heard, Gardnerson was badgering General Stonehand about strategy—like he knows anything about that. Wait until he's alone, then take care of him.~
@49833 = ~What the hells is going on here? ~ [BD49833]
@49834 = ~Pritchard Gardnerson, I presume?~
@49835 = ~Calm yourself, friend. The danger is over.~
@49836 = ~Sorry, who are you?~
@49837 = ~These men were traitors, working for Caelar. I slew them.~
@49838 = ~GardnersonSON. Explain yourself! Why have you killed my men? ~ [BD49838]
@49839 = ~They plotted to kill you.~
@49840 = ~It was self-defense. They drew on me, I had to respond in kind.~
@49841 = ~The hero of Baldur's Gate doesn't answer to you, gnome.~
@49842 = ~The hero of Baldur's Gate doesn't answer to you.~
@49843 = ~Pritchard! Cousin, it's me, Glint.~ [BD49843]
@49844 = ~Glint? What are you doing here? What's going on? Someone explain this to me now!~ [BD49844]
@49845 = ~I'm sorry to have to say this, Master Gardnersonson, but these men were plotting to kill you.~
@49846 = ~Glint? Would you care to explain this to your cousin?~
@49847 = ~It's simple enough—these men attacked me. I responded in kind. You see the result.~
@49848 = ~I am <CHARNAME>, hero of Baldur's Gate. I don't answer to you. If you have a problem with that, take it up with the Flaming Fist. I am here at the behest of the Grand Dukes.~
@49849 = ~What? I don't believe it. ~
@49850 = ~I understand why you wouldn't want to. Nevertheless, I speak the truth. If you don't believe me, take it up with the Flaming Fist. I am here at the behest of the Grand Dukes of Baldur's Gate.~
@49851 = ~That's unfortunate. But it doesn't make what I say untrue.~
@49852 = ~You call the hero of Baldur's Gate a liar?~
@49853 = ~What...? I-I don't believe it. ~
@49854 = ~I understand why you wouldn't want to. Nevertheless, I speak the truth. If you don't believe me, take it up with the Flaming Fist. I am here at the behest of the Grand Dukes of Baldur's Gate.~
@49855 = ~I'm sorry to hear that. But, believe it or don't, I speak the truth.~
@49856 = ~What you believe matters little to me. Begone.~
@49857 = ~Aye, aye. I'll be doing that, just you see if I don't.~
@49858 = ~Pritchard Gardnersonson, lieutenant of the Daggerford militia. Who the hells are you?~ [BD49858]
@49859 = ~I am <CHARNAME>. I regret to be to the one to tell you this, but these men meant you ill. They plotted to kill you. ~
@49860 = ~My name is <CHARNAME>. I am called the hero of Baldur's Gate by most. Is there something else you'd rather call me? ~
@49861 = ~This—this—this isn't over! We are not done, you and I!~
@49862 = ~You've killed members of Daggerford's militia! That's the last mistake you'll make for a long time.~
@49863 = ~The hero of—? No, no, I don't—forgive me, my <PRO_LADYLORD>. I was just—taken aback by all this. I'll, ah—I'll let you be on your way.~
@49864 = ~Danger? What danger? What are you talking about?~
@49865 = ~These treacherous cowards plotted to kill a member of Daggerford's militia named Gardnerson.~
@49866 = ~I acted in self-defense. These men drew on me. I had no choice but to respond in kind.~
@49867 = ~The hero of Baldur's Gate doesn't answer to you. If you've a problem with that, take it up with the Flaming Fist.~
@49868 = ~I'm really sorry about all this, Pritchard. There was a, uh, a misunderstanding, that's all. It got out of hand. Unfortunate, but it happens. You might still be able to revive these men if you act quickly.~ [BD49868]
@49869 = ~Someone fetch a cleric! These men need help!~
@49870 = ~Where are you going? I'm an officer of the Daggerford militia! Do as I say! You can't leave! Take <PRO_HIMHER>! Take <PRO_HIMHER>, damn it!~
@49871 = ~This—this—this isn't over! We are not done, you and I!~
@49872 = ~Damn it all, Stonehand! Listen to what I'm saying!~
@49873 = ~I've listened, Pritchard. I listened once, then I listened again, then I listened a dozen more times!~
@49874 = ~Now I'm done listening. Open your mouth again and I move on to horrible maiming!~
@49875 = ~You're out of your bloody mind, Pritchard. Keep this up and you'll be out of bloody teeth too!~ [BD49875]
@49876 = ~If we move now, we can take Caelar's people by surprise!~
@49877 = ~You don't know that and even if you did, it's not your decision to make. Just let it go, Pritchard. Like it or not, we aren't the ones who get to make the call.~ [BD49877]
@49878 = ~Pritchard? Pritchard Gardnerson?~
@49879 = ~Ho there, Stonehand. What's going on here?~
@49880 = ~What call would that be, General Stonehand?~
@49881 = ~If you do not get to make it, then who will?~
@49882 = ~Trouble with your dogs, Stonehand? Perhaps you should give them a treat. Or put them down.~
@49883 = ~Pritchard! Cousin, it's me—Glint!~ [BD49883]
@49884 = ~GardnersonSON. Who are you, now?~
@49885 = ~Pritchard, this is <CHARNAME>, hero of Baldur's Gate. <CHARNAME>, Pritchard Gardnersonson.~ [BD49885]
@49886 = ~We've met. Much to my regret.~
@49887 = ~A hero in Baldur's Gate, a pariah in Dragonspear. Such is life, eh?~ [BD49887]
@49888 = ~Oh, right. You're the one who had the... incident crossing Boareskyr. How do you almost know my name?~ [BD49888]
@49889 = ~I believe I know a relative of yours. Glint?~
@49890 = ~There's a couple of men around the corner who asked me to kill you. Damius and Sempek, do you know them?~
@49891 = ~I was asked to find you and bring you to Quartermaster Belegarm. He's got a gnomish item he believes you might be interested in.~
@49892 = ~I must have overheard it somewhere. Excuse me.~
@49893 = ~My cousin's here? Bloody hells. Lock up the gold. I guess I'd best go find him and say hello. We'll continue this discussion later, Haither.~
@49894 = ~It'd be healthier for you if we didn't.~ [BD49894]
@49895 = ~Fare thee well.~
@49896 = ~WHAT? Those ungrateful swine, I'll have them drawn and quartered!~
@49897 = ~The hells you will. I'll deal with this. And you, <CHARNAME>—stop making mischief, you hear me? We've got enough problems here without you making more of 'em. But you did good bringing this to my attention, and now I've got someone I can hit in good conscience. Here, take this as thanks.~ [BD49897]
@49898 = ~Pritchard here thinks we should send a small force into Dragonspear to try and take out Caelar and end this mess before the real battle gets underway.~ [BD49898]
@49899 = ~As I EXPLAINED to him, we aren't operating independently here. The camp commanders have to agree on that sort of action.~ [BD49899]
@49900 = ~And you think they won't agree.~
@49901 = ~Democracy. It's a wonderful thing.~
@49902 = ~A force like this can only function with a single leader. One voice must command, or chaos will reign.~
@49903 = ~Nederlok might go for it. De Lancie, though? He's happy enough try and starve Caelar out. Anything to avoid bloodshed.~ [BD49903]
@49904 = ~Now if you'll excuse me, I've gotta go talk to a hole in the ground about me peeing in it.~ [BD49904]
@49905 = ~Interesting. Lead the way.~
@49906 = ~Fare thee well. Now, Haither, where were we?~
@49907 = ~I was right here. You were going somewhere else, before I wring your bloody gnome neck.~ [BD49907]
@49908 = ~Aye, well. Here we are. Now if you'll excuse me, I've gotta talk to a hole in the ground about peeing in it.~ [BD49908]

@49911 = ~He's looking for you, Pritchard.~

@49913 = ~He's leaving. As am I.~
@49914 = ~Mum's been worried about the family. She sent me out to make sure everything's all right. Is it? Are you all right?~ [BD49914]
@49915 = ~I daresay I am. I'm a high-ranking member of the Daggerford militia. We were sent here to deal with that confounded Caelar.~
@49916 = ~As were we. I am <CHARNAME>.~
@49917 = ~How's that going for you?~
@49918 = ~Yet Caelar continues to confound you.~
@49919 = ~I've heard of you. You were involved in that... incident on Boareskyr Bridge.~
@49920 = ~Let's not talk of that, cousin. How is Aunt Wellsy? And Uncle Morsk?~ [BD49920]
@49921 = ~They're fine, Glint. Mother and father are both fine. Tell Auntie next time you see her. Now excuse me, please. I've important matters that require my attention. We can talk properly when this situation with Caelar is finally resolved.~
@49922 = ~It'd be a damn sight better if the camp commanders had either a modicum of courage or a hint of intelligence. We could end this siege inside of a day were we to move boldly and strike with precision.~ [BD49922]
@49923 = ~I'm, eh, sure you could. Excuse us, cousin. I need to talk to <CHARNAME> in private a moment.~ [BD49923]
@49924 = ~I've gotta go, Pritchard. We'll talk later, all right?~ [BD49924]
@49925 = ~I need to speak with you about my cousin, <CHARNAME>. ~ [BD49925]
@49926 = ~Of course, Glint.~
@49927 = ~I can't see any way to get out of this, so go ahead.~
@49928 = ~Your cousin is the last thing I wish to discuss right now.~
@49929 = ~You and me both. All right, I'll let it go for the moment.~ [BD49929]
@49930 = ~You may not have noticed this, but Pritchard... Well, he can be a bit of a handful. He's difficult enough under normal circumstances. Give him any kind of power and, well, it goes straight to his head.~ [BD49930]
@49931 = ~I was wondering if you could perhaps beat him to within an inch of his life.~ [BD49931]
@49932 = ~I'm really not comfortable with the direction this conversation is going.~
@49933 = ~Why on Toril would you want me to do that?~
@49934 = ~Absolutely.~
@49935 = ~Just try and stop me.~
@49936 = ~Glint, I can honestly say I would be delighted to do that for you.~
@49937 = ~If he stays in this camp, I guarantee you he's going to rub someone the wrong way—probably several someones. They're going to kill him. Kill him repeatedly, if history's anything to judge by. ~ [BD49937]
@49938 = ~So you want me to nearly kill him, to convince him to leave the camp.~
@49939 = ~Sounds like there's a story there, but we'll save it for another day. You want me to beat your cousin into a bloody pulp? It will be done.~
@49940 = ~And you'd deny them this pleasure? Well, he is family. Very well. I'll do as you ask.~
@49941 = ~Exactly. ~ [BD49941]
@49942 = ~That's a little extreme, isn't it?~
@49943 = ~All right. I'll do it, but only because you asked nicely and I don't really like your cousin much.~
@49944 = ~It's not often someone asks me to hurt a family member. I'll enjoy this.~
@49945 = ~You don't know Pritchard the way I do. There's only one way to get any message through that thick skull of his. Words alone just won't do it. ~ [BD49945]
@49946 = ~I'm sorry, Glint. I just can't do that. The idea alone makes me uneasy.~
@49947 = ~Very well. I'll do this for you.~
@49948 = ~Fortunately, I have more than words at my disposal.~
@49949 = ~Thank you, <CHARNAME>. I can't tell you how much I appreciate this.~ [BD49949]
@49950 = ~I don't want him dead, you understand. I just need him... humbled. Beaten down enough that he'll agree to leave this place. He won't serve anyone being here, not himself, not his fellow militia members. He might help Caelar, but that's obviously not ideal.~ [BD49950]
@49951 = ~I thought the quartermaster was over there. ~
@49952 = ~So this item your quartermaster has for me—what is it?~
@49953 = ~<CHARNAME>? What is the item?~
@49954 = ~What are you doing—?~
@49955 = ~Help! Someone help me!~
@49956 = ~Mercy! Please, show mercy, I beg you!~ [BD49956]
@49957 = ~That's enough, <CHARNAME>.~ [BD49957]
@49958 = ~Let me live, please, please! I want to live!~
@49959 = ~You'll live. Go, get out of this camp. Return to Daggerford and your family and don't ever speak of what happened here again. Do you understand?~
@49960 = ~That's unfortunate, because you aren't going to.~
@49961 = ~How badly? How much is your wretched life worth to you?~
@49962 = ~Yes, my <PRO_LADYLORD>. Thank you, thank you!~
@49963 = ~Here, take this dagger. It's a family heirloom, the most valuable thing I have. Take it and let me live, please.~
@49964 = ~Glint! Cousin! What's going on—I don't understand...~ [BD49964]
@49965 = ~I'm sorry, Pritchard. You've got to leave the camp. Go back to Daggerford.~ [BD49965]
@49966 = ~But—why...?~
@49967 = ~Glint fears for your life, Pritchard. There are people here who mean to harm you, even worse than you are now. As hard as it may be to believe, we did this out of love.~
@49968 = ~It's for your own good.~
@49969 = ~This is no place for a gnome like you.~
@49970 = ~Mum would never forgive me if I let you die, Pritchard. You've got to get out of here.~ [BD49970]
@49971 = ~This was going to be my chance... I was going to prove myself...~
@49972 = ~You're a good man, Pritchard. Don't become a good dead man.~ [BD49972]
@49973 = ~All-All right. I'll go. Here, take this dagger. It was father's. He used it during the last two Dragonspear wars. It's only fitting a Gardnersonson fighting this one wield it now. Goodbye, cousin. Farewell.~ [BD49973]
@49974 = ~You done the deed yet? Is that waddling bag of pus Pritchard still with us?~
@49975 = ~Where can I find Pritchard again?~
@49976 = ~For the moment. I'm working on it.~
@49977 = ~When he is, I'll let you know. Until then, don't talk to me.~
@49978 = ~No. He's gone, and he'll not be returning any time soon.~
@49979 = ~Pritchard Gardnerson won't be bothering you again, let's put it that way.~
@49980 = ~I have slain him. Give me what I was promised, or I'll do the same to you.~
@49981 = ~Right, right. Don't want to be associated with each other, just in case. Good idea.~
@49982 = ~Any time now would be good.~
@49983 = ~He's probably hanging around General Stonehand's tent, bothering her with his brilliant plans to end this bloody standoff. Try there.~
@49984 = ~You did it? All right! Here's the potions. Worth it to see that worthless lackwit gone.~
@49985 = ~Oh! Who are you? ~ [BD49985]
@49986 = ~Don't be afraid. I'm <CHARNAME>. Are you with the crusade?~
@49987 = ~<CHARNAME>. Hero of Baldur's Gate. Perhaps you've heard of me? No? How long have you been in this wretched place?~
@49988 = ~Someone who values privacy. Return to your task and leave me to mine.~
@49989 = ~Rhonda? Is it really you? What are you doing down here?~ [BD49989]
@49990 = ~I don't even know how long I've been down here anymore. The crusade took my family, my father and brothers—I don't know what happened to them. ~ [BD49990]
@49991 = ~Not by choice. They took my family, my father and brothers—I don't know what happened to them. ~
@49992 = ~Yes, <PRO_SIRMAAM>. I'll just do that.~
@49993 = ~They found out I knew how to use a needle and thread and stuck me in this place mending their clothes.~
@49994 = ~It's not likely you'll have a better chance than this to escape. I've eliminated a good portion of those who'd stop you. Leave now, make your way out of the river caverns.~
@49995 = ~Get out of here. Run, as fast and far away from here as possible.~
@49996 = ~They'll have little use for clothes where I'm going to send them.~
@49997 = ~You're not with the crusade, then? No, I can see you aren't. Your eyes are—different from theirs.~
@49998 = ~You'll come with me?~
@49999 = ~I'm afraid not. There's still much I must do down here.~
