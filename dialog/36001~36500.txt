@36001 = ~Hah! See? I told you. A customer. I can stay! ~
@36002 = ~A little turnip juice never hurt anyone. Let her go through the camp and ply her trade. ~
@36003 = ~No, you can't. We have serious business to attend to here. Move along. ~
@36004 = ~You heard <PRO_HIMHER>. Take your tubersauce and shove off. ~
@36005 = ~You haven't heard the last of me! I'll be back! THE TURNIP WILL NOT BE DISRESPECTED! ~
@36006 = ~*sigh* As you will, my <PRO_LADYLORD>. ~
@36007 = ~One turnip juice! Don't forget to tell your friends! ~ [BD36007]
@36008 = ~Look, there on that cart.~
@36009 = ~What is it? ~
@36010 = ~It's—it's a cart filled with scrolls! Gods, what wonders you have shown me!~
@36011 = ~Moldy papers and other useless junk. ~
@36012 = ~Stow the sarcasm, <CHARNAME>. That feather there is from a planetar's wing. YOU CAN STOW THE SARCASM TOO, ADOY!~ [BD36012]
@36013 = ~That feather's one more stone on the path to get Adoy out of—wherever he is, and out of my life at the same time. ~ [BD36013]
@36014 = ~Yeah? Well, I won't miss YOU either. ~ [BD36014]
@36015 = ~A feather from a planetar's wing. One more—SHUT UP, SHUT UP, SHUT UP, SHUT UP! Sorry. As I was TRYING to say, the feather's the next stone on my path to getting THIS guy OUT OF MY HEAD.~ [BD36015]
@36016 = ~Sorry. As I was TRYING to say, the feather's the next stone on my path to getting THIS guy OUT OF MY HEAD. ~
@36017 = ~Useless to YOU, perhaps. But not to the keenly probing eyes of the Red Wizard... ~
@36018 = ~I don't care about the moldy papers. It's the feather there that I want. The feather of a planetar's—OH, FOR THE LOVE OF ALL THAT'S HOLY, WILL YOU PLEASE SHUT UP? Sorry. As I was TRYING to say, the feather's the next stone on my path to getting THIS guy OUT OF MY HEAD.~ [BD36018]
@36019 = ~<CHARNAME>? I know this is silly, but I can't seem to find room for the feather in my pack. Help me out? ~ [BD36019]
@36020 = ~You can't fit a single feather in your pack? What's taking up all that space? ~
@36021 = ~Oh, you know. Things. Thank you! ~ [BD36021]
@36022 = ~<CHARNAME>? The feather? I could really use it. ~ [BD36022]
@36023 = ~I'm trying, just be quiet and give me some time...~ [BD36023]
@36024 = ~What do you say, <CHARNAME>? It's just a feather.~ [BD36024]
@36025 = ~Light. Easy to carry. Critical element of the potion that'll get this demented loon out of my head. ~
@36026 = ~Light. Easy to carry. Critical element of the potion that'll get this demented loon out of my head. Very, very useful...~ [BD36026]
@36027 = ~<CHARNAME>? The feather? I could really use it. ~ [BD36027]
@36028 = ~<CHARNAME>? I know this is silly, but I can't seem to find room for the feather in my pack. Help me out? ~
@36029 = ~You can't fit a single feather in your pack? What's taking up all that space? ~
@36030 = ~Thanks, <CHARNAME>. You're the best! ~
@36031 = ~I REALLY need that feather, <CHARNAME>. ~ [BD36031]
@36032 = ~Eight, eight. One two three four times two makes eight... Darn it! ~
@36033 = ~Eight, eight. One two three four times two makes eight... Darn it! It shouldn't be this hard to find a seven-legged spider!~ [BD36033]
@36034 = ~A seven-legged spider? I can't say I've ever seen such a thing.~
@36035 = ~If you want a seven-legged spider, look for a five-legged fly. ~
@36036 = ~What could you possibly want with a seven-legged spider? ~
@36037 = ~Funny. ~ [BD36037]
@36038 = ~I need to get rid of Adoy. Well, not get rid of him—YES, Adoy, I was just about to say—not get rid of him, but to get him out of wherever he is. And MY HEAD.~ [BD36038]
@36039 = ~A seven-legged spider, you say. ~
@36040 = ~We need to find a way to shut that loon up before he drives you crazy. Well, craziER. You're already pretty—well, you know.~
@36041 = ~Are you sure he's real? The voice in your head, I mean. ~
@36042 = ~It'll be six-legged when I've gotten what I need. ~ [BD36042]
@36043 = ~Vott? It is a seven-legged spider you are seeking? ~ [BD36043]
@36044 = ~You know where I can find a seven-legged spider? ~ [BD36044]
@36045 = ~Ja! With a horde of eight-legged ones. I came across just such a spider journeying back from the Forest of Wyrms. ~
@36046 = ~Ja! With a horde of eight-legged ones. I came across just such a spider journeying back from the Forest of Wyrms. It is not far from here. Perhaps you let old Voghiln take you where you want to go, eh?~ [BD36046]
@36047 = ~We all want to go there. ~
@36048 = ~Just draw us a map. ~
@36049 = ~Women like Neera don't go where you want to take them, skald. Not ever.~
@36050 = ~All? All right, Voghiln can do that. And when we get the spider, the elf lass can thank Voghiln personally, ja? ~ [BD36050]
@36051 = ~Damn it, <CHARNAME>! Voghiln is a singer, not a car—a cart, cartog— ~ [BD36051]
@36052 = ~You can do it. You're almost there... ~ [BD36052]
@36053 = ~A mapmaker. But I will do what I can. ~ [BD36053]
@36054 = ~I'm a half-elf. ~ [BD36054]
@36055 = ~Half-elf, but all woman. Just the way Voghiln likes 'em! ~ [BD36055]
@36056 = ~Voghiln couldn't help but overhear you just then. It might be the mighty boar of Luskan can help you.~ [BD36056]
@36057 = ~Is he real? Of course he's—YES, I'M TELLING <PRO_HIMHER>—of course he's real!~ [BD36057]
@36058 = ~He's very real! He's TOO real! And he WON'T STOP TALKING! ~ [BD36058]
@36059 = ~I need help, <CHARNAME>! I need the leg of a seven-legged spider! ~ [BD36059]
@36060 = ~Vott? You insult the great balladeer of the Luskan crags! Voghiln should turn you upside down and use your face to dig a grave! ~ [BD36060]
@36061 = ~Yeah, fine, do that, but can he draw us a map to the seven-legged spider first?~ [BD36061]
@36062 = ~Damn it! Voghiln is a singer, not a car—a cart, a cartog—~ [BD36051]
@36063 = ~I can scarcely believe I'm saying this, but I know where you can find one. I encountered a cluster of giant spiders not far from here. One had seven legs. ~
@36064 = ~I need to get rid of Adoy. Well, not get rid of him—YES, Adoy, I was just about to say—not get rid of him, but to get him out of wherever he is. And MY HEAD.~ [BD36064]
@36065 = ~A seven-legged spider, you say. ~
@36066 = ~We need to find a way to shut that loon up before he drives you crazy. Crazier, I mean. You're already pretty—well, you know. ~
@36067 = ~Are you sure he's real? The voice in your head I mean. ~
@36068 = ~It'll be six-legged when I've gotten what I need. ~ [BD36068]
@36069 = ~I haven't seen one, but I'll keep an eye out. ~
@36070 = ~It seems Tymora smiles upon you, Neera. I've actually got a seven-legged spider leg. Here, take it.~
@36071 = ~I can scarcely believe I'm saying this, but I know where you can find one. I encountered a cluster of giant spiders not far from here. One had seven legs. ~
@36072 = ~I need to go there. RIGHT NOW. Can you take me, pleeeeease?~ [BD36072]
@36073 = ~Can you take me, pleeeeease? ~ [BD36073]
@36074 = ~I do know. And you have no idea how sad it makes me to admit it—ADOY, IF YOU DON'T STOP YAMMERING, I SWEAR I'M GOING TO BLUDGEON MYSELF TO DEATH WITH A ROCK! Sorry, sorry. But yeah. I need help. Really.~ [BD36074]
@36075 = ~Sorry, sorry. But yeah. I need help. Really. ~ [BD36075]
@36076 = ~This... This is AWESOME. Thank you so, so much, <CHARNAME>! Yeah. Yeah, this'll be perfect.~ [BD36076]
@36077 = ~Yeah. Yeah, this'll be perfect. ~ [BD36077]
@36078 = ~I knew it was a long shot. Thanks, <CHARNAME>. ~ [BD36078]
@36079 = ~He's very real! He's TOO real! And he WON'T STOP TALKING! Sorry, sorry. But yeah. I need help. Really.~ [BD36079]
@36080 = ~Are those—? They are! Spiders! How many legs do they have? HOW MANY?~ [BD36080]
@36081 = ~How many legs do they have? HOW MANY? ~ [BD36081]
@36082 = ~That one in the back—it's got seven legs! THAT'S THE ONE! KILL IT! KILL IT! ~ [BD36082]
@36083 = ~I need one of the seven-legged spider's legs. Just one. That's all I want. ~ [BD36083]
@36084 = ~Yeah. Yeah, this'll be perfect. Thank you so much, <CHARNAME>. At this rate, I won't be driven completely mad before I get rid of—I mean, before I free Adoy. ~ [BD36084]
@36085 = ~Hey! Spider leg? Please?~ [BD36085]
@36086 = ~You're killing me, you know that, <CHARNAME>? You. Are. KILLING. Me. ~ [BD36086]
@36087 = ~All right! That's everything I need! LET'S DO THIS! Any time it's convenient for you, of course, <CHARNAME>. But, uh. Sooner. Sooner is better. Right now would be best.~ [BD36087]
@36088 = ~...any time it's convenient for you, of course, <CHARNAME>. But, uh. Sooner. Sooner is better. Right now would be best. ~
@36089 = ~But any time you're ready, I can brew this godsforsaken potion and finally silence this godsforsaken mage in my godsforsaken head! YES, I HEARD THAT! ~ [BD36089]
@36090 = ~Deep breaths, Neera. Okay. Whenever you're good, <CHARNAME>, I'm good. Good. I'm good. ~ [BD36090]
@36091 = ~I'm so very, very ready for this to be over already. Go to sleep, <CHARNAME>. This is gonna take a while.~ [BD36091]
@36092 = ~IT IS DONE. Ha hah! It is done! Dramatic, huh? All right... here goes nothing...~ [BD36092]
@36093 = ~Dramatic, huh? All right... here goes nothing... ~
@36094 = ~Yes. Yes. YES! Silence—blissful, glorious silence! I never thought I'd hear it again. Or not hear it again. Can you hear silence? ~ [BD36094]
@36095 = ~Adoy's still there, I can feel him, but I can live with that. I think I could even... I totally could. But should I? ~ [BD36095]
@36096 = ~Slow down. Use your words. ~
@36097 = ~Should you explain to us what in the hells you're talking about? Yes. You should definitely do that.~
@36098 = ~Do whatever you're going to do, but do it quickly. We've lost enough time dealing with your imaginary friend. ~
@36099 = ~Fine. I get it. Stop talking about Adoy. Done. My lips are sealed. Onward!~ [BD36099]
@36100 = ~Right. Words. Okay. ~ [BD36100]
@36101 = ~Sheesh, witchy britches. Calm down. ~ [BD36101]
@36102 = ~The potion helped me focus. At least, I think that's what it did. I can control our link, anyway. That's the important bit. ~ [BD36102]
@36103 = ~I can kind of—make him louder or quieter. If that makes sense. ~ [BD36103]
@36104 = ~I THINK I could sever the connection completely if I wanted. Just... cut him off. I'm just not so sure I should.~ [BD36104]
@36105 = ~Really? Why not? ~
@36106 = ~What's the alternative? ~
@36107 = ~It's your head, Neera. You've got to do what's best for you. ~
@36108 = ~I get that. I do. But... ~ [BD36108]
@36109 = ~He's trapped... somewhere. I think he's in trouble. If I cut him off, what'll happen to him? ~ [BD36109]
@36110 = ~If he's in trouble, we should try to save him. ~
@36111 = ~Why do you care? ~
@36112 = ~As long as it doesn't happen to you, what difference does it make? ~
@36113 = ~I'm not really sure yet. ~ [BD36113]
@36114 = ~All right, I'm gonna talk to him.~ [BD36114]
@36115 = ~Take as long as you need. ~
@36116 = ~Well, that should be fun. And by fun, I mean the exact opposite of fun. ~
@36117 = ~Keep it quick. We've got things to do. ~
@36118 = ~After everything he's put me through, I almost *want* him to suffer, but... he's still a wild mage. I can't just leave him, can I? ~ [BD36118]
@36119 = ~I would. ~
@36120 = ~I guess not? ~
@36121 = ~I think you already know the answer to that question. ~
@36122 = ~You're right. Whatever it is—he got himself into it, he can get himself OUT of it. This'll just take a second...~ [BD36122]
@36123 = ~This'll just take a second... ~ [BD36123]
@36124 = ~FREEDOMMMMM! No more Adoy, no more headaches... I could kiss you! ~ [BD36124]
@36125 = ~Now there's a thought... ~
@36126 = ~What do you think will happen to Adoy? ~
@36127 = ~Then let's get going. ~
@36128 = ~Hey, at least you don't have to listen to the guy. Give me a sec; this won't take long...~ [BD36128]
@36129 = ~...I don't CARE if it's embarrassing, just TELL ME WHERE YOU ARE. ~ [BD36129]
@36130 = ~Oh, you have got to be kidding... How in the hells did you manage that? ~ [BD36130]
@36131 = ~Yes, I know you're not in one of the Hells. It was— Just listen a sec— Stop flapping your insubstantial ghost lips, PLEASE. Oh, that does it—this talk is over. I can do that now. BYE.~ [BD36131]
@36132 = ~That does it—this talk is over. I can do that now. BYE. ~
@36133 = ~Fugue Plane. Ugh. Okay. It *sounds* like he's trapped in the Fugue Plane.~ [BD36133]
@36134 = ~The Fugue Plane? ~
@36135 = ~Isn't the Fugue Plane where souls go when they die? ~
@36136 = ~How did he get there? ~
@36137 = ~And how would we bring him back? ~
@36138 = ~I've had a few too many thoughts in my head lately. It's time to act. Come a little closer... ~ [BD36138]
@36139 = ~Mmm. Not bad. I'd rate it a six out of ten. A solid effort. ~ [BD36139]
@36140 = ~I guess I'll just have to keep practicing, won't I? ~
@36141 = ~Next time, I'll try harder. ~
@36142 = ~...uh, okay... Hey, we should. Um. Go. Yes. ~ [BD36142]
@36143 = ~The others are staring. ~ [BD36143]
@36144 = ~Onward! ~ [BD36144]
@36145 = ~Please don't stop on our account. ~ [BD36145]
@36146 = ~Don't encourage them. There's a time for romance, and this isn't it.~ [BD36146]
@36147 = ~Still thy tongue, gnome. We've other things to do. ~ [BD36147]
@36148 = ~Other things to do. Right. Onward! ~ [BD36148]
@36149 = ~Ah. Yeah, I guess it is a thought. I think—it'd probably be best if we kept it that way. Onward!~ [BD36149]
@36150 = ~Don't know, don't care. He's caused me more than enough misery. Onward!~ [BD36150]
@36151 = ~Sounds like a plan to me! Onward!~ [BD36151]
@36152 = ~It's the place souls go after their host bodies die. Not a nice place to visit, and you shouldn't be able to live there, even though Adoy is somehow managing it.~ [BD36152]
@36153 = ~Yeah. How he got there, I don't know. ~ [BD36153]
@36154 = ~Also very difficult to get to if you're not, you know, dead. Then again, my magic has done some pretty crazy things in the past... I guess it's not totally out of the question. ~
@36155 = ~My magic's done some pretty crazy things in the past... I guess it's not totally out of the question. ~ [BD36155]
@36156 = ~He says there's some kind of mountain nearby that can help him out. I think he said mountain. He was, uh, agitated. Anyway, if I can find this Mountain of Nepenthe, I can bring him back to the Material Plane. ~ [BD36156]
@36157 = ~So where do we start? ~
@36158 = ~And we want to do this because...? ~
@36159 = ~Mountain of Nepenthe. Never heard of it. ~
@36160 = ~You understand this is a distraction from our goal here, right? If we have a chance to help Adoy, fine, but ending Caelar's crusade is the important thing. ~
@36161 = ~Because if I were stuck in some kind of limbo dimension and another wild mage knew about it, I'd hope she'd help me. ~ [BD36161]
@36162 = ~Adoy'll tell me when we're near. It's roughly north of here, so it's on our way... I think. Guess we'll find out. ~ [BD36162]
@36163 = ~Yeah. Me neither. Adoy'll tell me when we're near. It's roughly north of here, so it's on our way... I think. Guess we'll find out.~ [BD36163]
@36164 = ~I get it. Adoy'll tell me when we're near. It's roughly north of here, so it's on our way... I think. Guess we'll find out.~ [BD36164]
@36165 = ~Yes! One step closer to getting rid of a certain someone. You know who I'm talking about, Adoy...~ [BD36165]
@36166 = ~Is this how you handle rejection, Voghiln? Not very suave. Perhaps I should give you some lessons on subtlety.~
@36167 = ~Who goes there? Boareskyr Bridge is the crusade's now, and Bridgefort will be soon enough. None but those who follow the Shining Lady shall pass here.~
@36168 = ~Excellent news, for I have come to serve under Caelar's banner.~
@36169 = ~I bring word from Caelar. Where is the camp commander? ~
@36170 = ~I am <CHARNAME>, slayer of unwary guards. ~
@36171 = ~You think you want to see the Barghest? Think again. Find the gnoll, Kharm. He'll get you set up. ~
@36172 = ~You have my thanks. ~
@36173 = ~Kharm, you say? ~
@36174 = ~"The Barghest"?~
@36175 = ~Pretty much the whole camp's taking part in Enlightenment right now. It's at the fire pit over yonder. You'll find him there.~
@36176 = ~Whoa, whoa, whoa. Not so fast there.~
@36177 = ~Joining the crusade takes heart. Determination. Commitment. And 100 gold pieces to get past me.~
@36178 = ~I don't have that much money. ~
@36179 = ~I have nothing to offer Caelar but my service. ~
@36180 = ~Stand aside. NOW. Or you won't like what happens next.~
@36181 = ~Perhaps you have something else you'd be willing to exchange. What do you say, darling? ~
@36182 = ~You disgust me, you wretched little creature. ~
@36183 = ~Not if you were the last man in Faer?n. What am I saying? You'd have to be a man to begin with for that to happen. ~
@36184 = ~I say you just made your last mistake. ~
@36185 = ~Perhaps one of your friends here might have something to exchange. Standing guard for the crusade... it gets lonely, if you get my meaning. ~
@36186 = ~You sicken me. ~
@36187 = ~Let us pass, or I'll see to it your commander finds out you're barring recruits from the crusade. ~
@36188 = ~In about fifteen seconds, you're going to WISH you were alone. ~
@36189 = ~Then I'm afraid you're out of luck. ~
@36190 = ~You'd seriously turn able-bodied people away from the crusade for a paltry 100 gold pieces?~
@36191 = ~One of us is. ~
@36192 = ~Stand aside. NOW. Or you won't like what happens next.~
@36193 = ~Aye, but like I say, it's Kharm you'll be talkin' to. Or maybe Munsch. ~
@36194 = ~I'll be on my way, then. Thank you. ~
@36195 = ~Where can I find them? ~
@36196 = ~I'll kill them all in due course. ~
@36197 = ~Frigid witch! ~
@36198 = ~I'll gut you like a pig! ~
@36199 = ~No need for that. I was just tryin' to get myself warm... ~
@36200 = ~Y'think so, do you?~
@36201 = ~You'll find Kharm just down the road. If you reach the bridge, you've gone too far. ~
@36202 = ~Back off. You want no part of me, believe me. ~
@36203 = ~Kill them—? ~
@36204 = ~Help! Help! The camp is under attack! ~
@36205 = ~So that's the way you want it, eh? All right. Just remember, we coulda done this the easy way. ~
@36206 = ~You'll find the Barghest is in the large tent, center of camp. It's just over there. You can't miss it.~
@36207 = ~You have my thanks. ~
@36208 = ~I cannot believe that worked. Thou hast a silver tongue.~
@36209 = ~Are you challenging me? You know the whole camp'll come down upon you, do you not? You against a hundred able-bodied soldiers. The commanders will think we're under attack and slaughter everyone in Bridgefort too, as like as not.~
@36210 = ~Give me the message. I'll see the right person gets it.~
@36211 = ~I have to give it to the commander directly. I'm under strict orders.~
@36212 = ~The message is most urgent. Do you really want me to tell your commander you kept me from delivering it as soon as possible?~
@36213 = ~I'm afraid I can't allow that. ~
@36214 = ~Oi! Jossain! Fetch the Barghest! ~
@36215 = ~You're under strict orders? You think I'm not? I'm guessing you've not met the Barghest. Now begone.~
@36216 = ~Allow? You're telling ME you won't allow— Oh. I get it. ~
@36217 = ~Unfortunately, you're not dealing with Caelar. Not until you make me happy. ~
@36218 = ~Hand over the gold, or begone. I'll waste no more time with you.~
@36219 = ~You threaten me? ~
@36220 = ~Joining the crusade takes heart. Determination. Commitment. ~
@36221 = ~Kharm is who you'll want to talk to... eventually. But you've got to understand what you'll be getting into serving the Shining Lady.~
@36222 = ~I see a lot of folk like you, looking to join Caelar. She's been making waves these past months. But it's not as easy as just sayin' "I want in." ~
@36223 = ~Keep your shield up 'less you want your head cut off, Deyghul! Keep it up! ~ [BD36223]
@36224 = ~You call that fighting? Pathetic! I faced worse than you sittin' on me granny's lap!~ [BD36224]
@36225 = ~Do you wretches think this is a game? Do you think Caelar's enemies are playin'? DO YOU?~ [BD36225]
@36226 = ~Hit him like you mean it, Fellik! You're not playing with your dollies now! ~ [BD36226]
@36227 = ~Fight like this when we get to the Hells and you're gonna die, you understand? I could weep. No god can save you lot. You're doomed!~ [BD36227]
@36228 = ~You, who are you? ~ [BD36228]
@36229 = ~Liam Ensler, sir. ~
@36230 = ~Liann Ensler, sir. ~
@36231 = ~I am <CHARNAME>. ~
@36232 = ~Trouble. ~
@36233 = ~Don't give me any lip, recruit! One word from me and this entire camp'll be on you. Do you really want to fight every soldier here at once?~ [BD36233]
@36234 = ~I'm still unaccustomed to being part of an army, sir. Forgive me.~
@36235 = ~I apologize, sir. I'm just so excited to be here fighting for Caelar. ~
@36236 = ~Bring it on, you filthy cur.~
@36237 = ~Servants of Caelar! Slay this unbeliever!~ [BD36237]
@36238 = ~That's the attitude I like to see. When did you join us?~ [BD36238]
@36239 = ~It's only been a couple days, sir. ~
@36240 = ~Delgar Munsch recruited me a few days ago.~
@36241 = ~I didn't. I dislike being on the losing side.~
@36242 = ~I don't recognize you. ~ [BD36242]
@36243 = ~I was recruited by Delgar Munsch, sir.~
@36244 = ~Should you? ~
@36245 = ~What of it?~
@36246 = ~Munsch is SUPPOSED to put all the new recruits past me first, but he often "forgets." One more time and I swear I'll have his leg off!~ [BD36246]
@36247 = ~He did strike me as a bit... difficult, sir. ~
@36248 = ~Good leaders are hard to find. Why the gods put fools in their place is beyond me.~
@36249 = ~As you should, sir. Now I must attend to my duties.~
@36250 = ~You know where Munsch is now? He and I are going to have words, we are. ~
@36251 = ~He's over yonder, sir. ~
@36252 = ~I've no idea. ~
@36253 = ~He's in the Nine Hells now. Here, I'll send you to him. ~
@36254 = ~Only if he knows how to talk with the dead. ~
@36255 = ~What?! We've been searching everywhere for that wardstone. You've proven yourself to me, soldier. I have a mission for you.~ [BD36255]
@36256 = ~I have every available crusader searching for a wardstone. They say it got stolen from the fort and it'll give us a way inside. If you find it, get it to me, and I'll give you an even more important mission.~ [BD36256]
@36257 = ~Dismissed.~ [BD36257]
@36258 = ~Talk with the— You're not crusaders! ~
@36259 = ~How would you like to prove yourself to me—to the man who really runs things for the rank and file crusaders?~
@36260 = ~You know we've managed to breach Bridgefort's outer wall? ~
@36261 = ~You have? ~
@36262 = ~The keep cannot hope to stand against the crusade. ~
@36263 = ~Very interesting. Here's something you may not know: The enemy's managed to breach your ranks. ~
@36264 = ~How long have you been with us? ~
@36265 = ~Not long, sir. ~
@36266 = ~Do you want to chat, or do you want to get to the point? ~
@36267 = ~Slightly longer than you have to live, fool. ~
@36268 = ~That wardstone will activate the teleport circle on the fort's eastern side. We can't get all our troops in that way, but you and a small contingent might be able to get through.~ [BD36268]
@36269 = ~And once inside, we could lower the drawbridge, giving the rest of our people access.~
@36270 = ~Sounds dangerous. Suicidal, even.~
@36271 = ~A significant risk. ~
@36272 = ~Prove your loyalty to the Shining Lady. Get into Bridgefort; lower the drawbridge. We'll have the unbelievers rounded up before they know what's happened.~ [BD36272]
@36273 = ~I don't think I'm the person for the job.~
@36274 = ~Oh, they'll know what happened. Trust me on this.~
@36275 = ~Quick. Devious. I like it.~
@36276 = ~Will you do it? ~ [BD36276]
@36277 = ~I will, sir. ~
@36278 = ~It's—well, it's a little dangerous, isn't it? For whoever has to get in there, I mean.~
@36279 = ~Never! I will lay down my life for Bridgefort. Every soldier here will die by my hand!~
@36280 = ~Slain—? ~
@36281 = ~Yessss... You know I handle new recruitment for the Blinding White battalion, right? And yet, and yet... ~
@36282 = ~Munsch! That rat-faced little... I'm Lieutenant Kharm. I handle all the new recruits for the Blinding White battalion.~ [BD36282]
@36283 = ~It IS a dangerous mission—and it's YOUR mission. Get inside that fort and lower the drawbridge or I'll have your head on a pike! Dismissed!~ [BD36283]
@36284 = ~A tolerable plan, but I've a better one. After you penetrate the fort, you'll lower the drawbridge for our forces to enter. We'll have the holdouts rounded up before they know what hit them.~
@36285 = ~If we've taken the breach, wouldn't it be easier to bring our men in there? ~
@36286 = ~I think they'll have a pretty good idea what hit them. ~
@36287 = ~An excellent plan. A pity you'll not live to receive the credit for it. ~
@36288 = ~But you're NOT in your rights to disobey a direct order. That's what I'm giving you now. Get inside that fort and lower the drawbridge or I'll strike your head from your shoulders! Dismissed!~
@36289 = ~Good. Move 'em out! ~ [BD36289]
@36290 = ~I'm Lieutenant Kharm. I handle the Blinding White battalion's new recruits. Which you SHOULD know...~ [BD36290]
@36291 = ~I was recruited by Delgar Munsch, sir.~
@36292 = ~You're Lieutenant Kharm? I've been looking all over for you. They said you'd give me an assignment. ~
@36293 = ~Oh, I knew. I just didn't care.~
@36294 = ~I like your attitude, recruit. How'd you like to prove yourself to me—the man who really runs things for the rank and file around here?~ [BD36294]
@36295 = ~Oy! I want to speak with Munsch! Where's the frogfiddler hiding? ~
@36296 = ~For a significant reward. ~
@36297 = ~An assignment, yes. I've just the thing...~ [BD36297]
@36298 = ~Awright. What's this all about, then? ~
@36299 = ~You are the Barghest? ~
@36300 = ~I bring word from Caelar for the Barghest. ~
@36301 = ~I've a message for the Barghest, from Baldur's Gate.~
@36302 = ~I'm Delgar Munsch. Right hand to Colonel Cordell, personal assistant to the Barghest. What's this all about?~
@36303 = ~A message, eh? Let's hear it.~
@36304 = ~It's not for your ears. ~
@36305 = ~I must give it to the Barghest directly.~
@36306 = ~It's a message best conveyed by things other than words. Your corpse should get it across quite nicely.~
@36307 = ~...What's your name again? ~
@36308 = ~I am <CHARNAME>. ~
@36309 = ~Liam Ensler. ~
@36310 = ~Liann Ensler. ~
@36311 = ~Do you really want to spend the last seconds of your miserable life asking stupid questions? ~
@36312 = ~The Barghest's a busy man. You want to talk to him, you gotta go through me. And you ain't goin' through me. Here's what's gonna happen. I'm gonna take you into custody. Then we're gonna sort this whole thing out. That sound good to you? If it doesn't—tough.~
@36313 = ~<CHARNAME>? You mean iron crisis <CHARNAME>? ~
@36314 = ~<CHARNAME>? You mean iron crisis <CHARNAME>? ~
@36315 = ~Well, listen up, Ensler—the Barghest is a very busy man. You want to talk to him, you gotta go through me. And you ain't goin' through me. ~
@36316 = ~I'm sorry to have bothered you. ~
@36317 = ~We shall see. ~
@36318 = ~And I'm sorry, but I can't let you leave. ~
@36319 = ~Uh-uh. You're not goin' anywhere. ~
@36320 = ~Come with me. ~
@36321 = ~Barghest's busy. I'm Munsch, Delgar Munsch. ~
@36322 = ~I have a message from Caelar for the Barghest. ~
@36323 = ~Who? ~
@36324 = ~Not for long, you aren't. ~
@36325 = ~You threaten an officer of the crusade, here? Are you mad? Attack me and you'll bring this entire camp down around your ears.~
@36326 = ~Surround <PRO_HIMHER>. Take 'em alive!~
@36327 = ~Let's hear it. ~
@36328 = ~It's not for your ears. ~
@36329 = ~Sorry, friend. I was told to give this to the Barghest and only the Barghest. ~
@36330 = ~I had hoped to give it directly to the Barghest, but your corpse should send the message eloquently enough. ~
@36331 = ~Do you know who I am? Do you know who I am? ~
@36332 = ~I'm Delgar Munsch! I'm the personal assistant to the Barghest's right hand! An' you won't give me your message? ~
@36333 = ~This had best be important. ~
@36334 = ~You are in command? ~
@36335 = ~I bring word from Caelar the Shining Lady. ~
@36336 = ~Very important. I bring a message from Baldur's Gate. ~
@36337 = ~Vichand! You treacherous swine! The moment of your comeuppance is at hand! ~
@36338 = ~That mage behind the Barghest—I recognize her. She was with Caelar at the Trade Way... ~
@36339 = ~Edwin Odesseiron. I thought you dead. It would have been best if you were... ~
@36340 = ~I am the Barghest, commander of the Blinding White battalion. ~
@36341 = ~I have a message for you from Caelar. ~
@36342 = ~Barghests are evil creatures who feast on the flesh of humans. What manner of person would name himself such a thing? ~
@36343 = ~Soon to be the dead commander of the Blinding White battalion. ~
@36344 = ~Treachery! Behind me, Commander—I'll deal with this! ~
@36345 = ~Strike them down. ~
@36346 = ~Do you now? As the Lady Caelar is on the other side of Boareskyr Bridge and Oloneiros here only recently left her company, I find that... unlikely. ~
@36347 = ~That mage behind the Barghest—I recognize her. She was with Caelar at the Trade Way... ~
@36348 = ~Death to Caelar! ~
@36349 = ~Do we really want to know? ~
@36350 = ~There was a time such words would have earned you a demonstration of how I earned my name. That was before I was saved by the light of Caelar. Who are you? Why are you here?~
@36351 = ~That was before I was saved by the light of Caelar. Who are you? Why are you here? ~
@36352 = ~I am <CHARNAME>. ~
@36353 = ~These are the questions that keep me awake at night. ~
@36354 = ~I have a message for you from the Grand Dukes of Baldur's Gate. ~
@36355 = ~You! Behind me, Commander. I'll deal with this. ~
@36356 = ~As you wish. ~
@36357 = ~You should try a nice cup of warm milk. ~
@36358 = ~I've neither the time nor the patience for this foolishness. ~
@36359 = ~Come on, come on...~
@36360 = ~Where are we going? ~
@36361 = ~If I must. ~
@36362 = ~I don't think so. ~
@36363 = ~The waiting room. ~
@36364 = ~We don't have time to wait, <CHARNAME>. People in Bridgefort are getting sick... ~
@36365 = ~I'm afraid you do. ~
@36366 = ~Something about the way you say that makes me think you're not the one who should be afraid right now. ~
@36367 = ~You're no messenger. Take <PRO_HIMHER>! ~
@36368 = ~At last, the time for violence has arrived. Come, crusader! Let Minsc introduce your face to the dirt! ~
@36369 = ~Damn it, <CHARNAME>! He believed you! We almost had a clear shot at the Barghest and you threw it away! ~
@36370 = ~And here we go again... ~
@36371 = ~Munsch! Who've you got with you? ~
@36372 = ~A messenger who wants an audience with the Barghest. ~
@36373 = ~Then why're you walking <PRO_HIMHER> past the Barghest's tent? I just saw him there. ~
@36374 = ~I'm not just takin' 'em to see the Barghest, idiot. I've got this. You just worry about getting your people ready to face the Hells. ~
@36375 = ~Here we are. Now, get in. ~
@36376 = ~I thought we were being taken to the Barghest. ~
@36377 = ~I think what we have here is a failure to communicate. I wish to see the Barghest. ~
@36378 = ~I'll not be caged, by you or any man. ~
@36379 = ~Jal khaless zhah waela. There is no "failure to communicate" here. ~
@36380 = ~You'll see the Barghest soon. After you get in the cage. ~
@36381 = ~I'd prefer to see him before bars get involved, if at all possible. ~
@36382 = ~This is how you treat a messenger bringing word from Caelar? ~
@36383 = ~I'll see him after I put you in the ground. ~
@36384 = ~Die, lackey of light! ~
@36385 = ~Yeah. If you didn't bring word from the light, we'd strip you of your weapons and armor and THEN make you get in the cage. Now get in the cage.~
@36386 = ~You're making a grave error. I'll be taking this up with your commander, you can be sure of that. ~
@36387 = ~Fair enough. ~
@36388 = ~Not going to happen. ~
@36389 = ~I'll risk it. ~
@36390 = ~Very well. ~
@36391 = ~You risk your life speaking to me like that. ~
@36392 = ~I knew it. You're no messengers. Kill them! Now! ~
@36393 = ~Good. That's good. I'll inform Colonel Cordell you've arrived. You guards stay here, make sure they stay safe.~
@36394 = ~I don't think he cares what you'd prefer. ~
@36395 = ~You don't get in the cage, there'll be more than bars involved—there'll be blades. Get in the cage. ~
@36396 = ~好吧。~
@36397 = ~Blades, you say? Bring them on. ~
@36398 = ~There's a wise <PRO_MANWOMAN>. In you go. ~
@36399 = ~I've been caged once too often already. I'll die before it happens again! ~
@36400 = ~Remind me to stay on your good side, goblin. ~
@36401 = ~I think we managed to take them out before they raised the alarm. That won't last. We'll need to move quickly before the entire camp's after us. ~
@36402 = ~Halt! Come no farther! ~ [BD36402]
@36403 = ~I wish to cross the bridge. ~
@36404 = ~Not even a little farther? Come on. A LITTLE farther won't harm anyone. ~
@36405 = ~You dare address me in such a manner? Let me speak to your commander! ~
@36406 = ~Caelar has decreed none shall pass. ~ [BD36406]
@36407 = ~Far be it from me to question the Shining Lady's orders. Farewell. ~
@36408 = ~That seems a little extreme. ~
@36409 = ~I've a sack of gold here that says otherwise. ~
@36410 = ~Caelar doesn't always get what she wants. ~
@36411 = ~Begone! ~ [BD36411]
@36412 = ~As you wish. ~
@36413 = ~I'm going, I'm going. Relax. ~
@36414 = ~I'll be back. ~
@36415 = ~Blessed be in the light of Caelar. ~
@36416 = ~My patience is wearing thin, <CHARNAME>. My patron demands blood—and soon. ~ [BD36416]
@36417 = ~I do as Caelar commands. A wise <PRO_MANWOMAN> would do the same. ~
@36418 = ~I'd take your money, but my standing aside would gain you little. The mage Oloneiros has warded the bridge. None shall walk its length while she lives.~
@36419 = ~Go forth in the light, <PRO_BROTHERSISTER>. ~
@36420 = ~You can talk to me or no one. Preferably no one. ~
@36421 = ~I would cross the bridge. ~
@36422 = ~I will return. When I do, it would be best if you were somewhere else. ~
@36423 = ~Well, she's getting this. The mage Oloneiros has magically warded the bridge. None shall walk its length while she lives.~
@36424 = ~For now, at least. ~
@36425 = ~You must feel truly fulfilled over there, telling people to not do what they can't do already. ~
@36426 = ~I will return. When I do, you'd be wise to be somewhere else. ~
@36427 = ~Return to your assignment, mercenary. When Bridgefort has fallen, then you shall cross Boareskyr. Not before.~ [BD36427]
@36428 = ~Yes, I heard you! Now shut up, please. ~ [BD36428]
@36429 = ~SHUT UP. ~ [BD36429]
@36430 = ~Shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, SHUT UUUUUUP. ~ [BD36430]
@36431 = ~WHAT? ~ [BD36431]
@36432 = ~Uh, I mean—hello! Hi! ~ [BD36432]
@36433 = ~Hello. ~
@36434 = ~She's c-coping as best she can, given the circumstances. We all are. ~
@36435 = ~Wait a second. I know that voice—NO, NOT YOURS, THE NEW ONE—yours. ~
@36436 = ~Of course you know me. <CHARNAME>. You helped me deal with the iron crisis... ~
@36437 = ~You don't remember me? <CHARNAME>? I helped you find that wild mage you were looking for...? ~
@36438 = ~You could get to know it if you wanted to. I am <CHARNAME>. And you are...? ~
@36439 = ~I don't believe you do. Nor will you start now. There's a Flaming Fist camp not far from here—I'll seek you out there should I have need of you.~
@36440 = ~Adoy. Don't say his name. I realize you didn't say his name; I said it. I wish I hadn't said it, and you definitely shouldn't say it. ~ [BD36440]
@36441 = ~Be quiet! I'm trying to talk to my friend here. Where was I? Oh, right. Adoy. He's been haunting me. Can you be haunted by someone who isn't dead?~ [BD36441]
@36442 = ~Neera. I'm a magician. ~ [BD36442]
@36443 = ~A wild magician. ~
@36444 = ~Yes, all right, I'm a wild magician. Are you happy now? ~ [BD36444]
@36445 = ~Half the damage y-you see around here is her doing. She was in a c-cell when Jaheira and I arrived. She m-made up for it, though. Her magic forced the crusade to k-keep its distance. ~
@36446 = ~Well, if you can't, he's doing what would be called haunting if he were dead. ~
@36447 = ~Yes, we're talking about you, and you aren't making it easy, so just be quiet. BE QUIET! ...You can't hear him, can you, <CHARNAME>? ~ [BD36447]
@36448 = ~No. ~
@36449 = ~Yes, you know me! Neera, remember?~ [BD36449]
@36450 = ~Neera! Excellent. I could use someone like you—if you'd care to join me? ~
@36451 = ~Oh, right. The wild mage. I helped you find another you thought could help you... ~
@36452 = ~Right, right. You're a wild mage too. We were looking for another you thought could help you. ~
@36453 = ~I don't. But that can change if you come with me. ~
@36454 = ~No. And I don't wish to start now. Get out of Bridgefort and go east. There's a Flaming Fist camp not far from here—I'll seek you out there should I have need of you.~
@36455 = ~She's—that might not be a great idea. Do you like raging, un-uncontrolled walls of flame? ~
@36456 = ~Shut up. And just so we're clear, I'm NOT talking to Adoy there, Khalid. Now, <CHARNAME>... ~ [BD36456]
@36457 = ~Can you get me out of this bloody fort? Yes? Count me in. ~ [BD36457]
@36458 = ~Wow. You've only been here a minute and you're already less pleasant than Adoy, which I didn't think was possible. ~ [BD36458]
@36459 = ~Don't let it go to your head, Adoy; you're still unbearable too. But at least I can ask this one to go away. You, <CHARNAME>. Go away. ~
@36460 = ~Take care. ~
@36461 = ~What are you doing here? How did you get in here, for that matter? ~ [BD36461]
@36462 = ~Baldur's Gate. There's a small force of Flaming Fist mercenaries less than a day from here. This siege won't last much longer. Would you like to help me break it? ~
@36463 = ~Come with me. I'll show you. ~
@36464 = ~I'd tell you, but I can't be certain who's listening. ~
@36465 = ~Yeah. Yeah, I guess that's fair. ~ [BD36465]
@36466 = ~Come with me and I'll take you with me when I depart. ~
@36467 = ~I'll leave you to—whatever it is you were doing. ~
@36468 = ~You can get me out of this bloody place? Yes. Count me in. ~
@36469 = ~Eh. I knew it was a long shot. ~ [BD36469]
@36470 = ~I'm trying to get the ingredients for a—hey, I'm trying to TALK here—for a potion that'll SHUT HIM THE HELLS UP. ~ [BD36470]
@36471 = ~What do you need? ~
@36472 = ~You clearly have more than enough voices vying for your attention. I'll not add mine to the load. Farewell. ~
@36473 = ~Nowhere to go but up, right? YES, I KNOW, ADOY, IT'S A FIGURE OF SPEECH. SHEESH! ~ [BD36473]
@36474 = ~Let's see. Dead water from beneath Boareskyr Bridge, got that already. The leg of a seven-legged spider. ~ [BD36474]
@36475 = ~I've no idea where you could find one of those. ~
@36476 = ~I do have the leg of such a spider. I don't know why I've got it, exactly, but I do. Take it, please. You'll be doing me a favor. ~
@36477 = ~I came upon a giant spider nest not far from here. We might be able to find a suitable leg there. ~
@36478 = ~Ho ho. Mighty Voghiln might know where you can find such a spider. It's not far from here. ~ [BD36478]
@36479 = ~Honestly? That is so, so great! ~ [BD36479]
@36480 = ~Does it need to have seven legs before or after you take its leg? ~ [BD36480]
@36481 = ~Before, I think. ~ [BD36481]
@36482 = ~I also need a feather from a planetar's wing, some belladonna, a potion of perception, and the juice of one turnip. ~ [BD36482]
@36483 = ~I have a planetar feather for you.~
@36484 = ~I came across a potion of perception not too long ago.~
@36485 = ~I have both the planetar feather and the potion of perception. They're yours.~
@36486 = ~Here, take the planetar feather and the potion of perception. Come with me and I'll help you find the others too.~
@36487 = ~I have the feather and the potion—they're yours if you need them. ~
@36488 = ~I don't have any of those things, but stick with me and we'll find them, I promise. ~
@36489 = ~I have none of those things. But I'll keep an eye out for them. ~
@36490 = ~Really? All right. I'm with you.~ [BD36490]
@36491 = ~I hope this isn't too forward, but I think I may be in love with you.~ [BD36491]
@36492 = ~Stick with me and we'll find the rest of the ingredients. I promise. ~
@36493 = ~Stick with me and we'll find all the ingredients you need. I promise. ~
@36494 = ~Come on. We've things to do. ~
@36495 = ~Good luck finding the rest of the ingredients. ~
@36496 = ~And you're just going to hand it over to the elf, aren't you? You make me sad, <CHARNAME>. ~ [BD36496]
@36497 = ~I'm a half-elf, lady. And I've got more than enough grating voices in my head right now, so I'll thank you for not adding yours to the din. ~ [BD36497]
@36498 = ~You'll give me the potion, <CHARNAME>? ~ [BD36498]
@36499 = ~I will, just as soon as I get ahold of it.~
@36500 = ~Of course. ~
