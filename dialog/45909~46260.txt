@45910 = ~Gentrus's Hand Mirror~
@45911 = ~The town of Soubar has earned its reputation as a lawless and dangerous place. The rampant brigandry in the area means a great many stolen goods are funneled through Soubar's back rooms and inns. One of the town's residents, the halfling Gentrus, crafted this mirror to help him divine the true nature of items he wished to buy. After a close call with a wererat, Gentrus decided to leave Soubar for the safety of Baldur's Gate, joining a caravan traveling north. The halfling died on the road during a bandit attack, but the caravan's survivors drove off the bandits. They ensured Gentrus's body and possessions made it to his relatives.

@45912 = ~Cloak of the Beluir Watch~
@45913 = ~Beluir is the capital city in the halfling kingdom of Lurien, and many brave halflings show their loyalty to their home by serving in the city watch. Like any large city, Beluir has its share of crime, and city guards must show alertness and courage every day they serve. While some halflings serve only a few years before moving on to other jobs or out of the city, many become lifelong members of the watch. This cloak is a reward for five years of service and bears an inscripion in Lurien on the clasp. The inscription reads, ʺLead By Example,ʺ one of the tenets of the halfling god Yondalla.

@45915 = ~Shield of Barnassus: The Suncatcher
Barnassus, a cleric of Lathander, created a polished bronze shield hundreds of years ago in order to battle a medusa rumored to be lurking in the catacombs beneath his city. Barnassus tracked the medusa to her lair and realized, almost too late, that what he faced was no ordinary medusa but one that had also succumbed to the curse of vampirism.

Barnassus closed his eyes and charged forward, ready to take down his enemy or die trying. Lathander rewarded Barnassus's bravery by filling the room with sunlight while the priest slew the medusa.

@45916 = ~Heya, careful with that rope. We can't have the hero of Baldur's Gate falling to their death—the Grand Dukes would be SO embarrassed.~
@45917 = ~Gods! I hope this is the last time we have to stick our nose in such a musty old place.~
@45918 = ~Keep your voice down, m'lady. They'll hear us coming.~
@45919 = ~Aw, who's afraid of a few—~
@45920 = ~We've been discovered! Kill them!~
@45921 = ~You'll come no further!~
@45922 = ~Alathan's blood, girl! I warned you to keep your voice down!~
@45923 = ~<CHARNAME>? Are you all right? ~
@45924 = ~I'm fine, Imoen. Why do you ask?~
@45925 = ~I'm better than all right. I'm the gods damned hero of Baldur's Gate.~
@45926 = ~I'm—fine.~
@45927 = ~I'm fine, Imoen. You mustn't worry about me so much.~
@45928 = ~Less talking, more opening the door that I may slay my enemies.~
@45929 = ~I'm fine. Do not question me again.~
@45930 = ~Thy mind was clearly elsewhere, <CHARNAME>. Thou must focus if we are to survive the coming trials.~
@45931 = ~Take care, wael. Your attempt to crush doubts does little but inspire them.~
@45932 = ~We are kicking butts—for justice! And the Grand Dukes of Baldur's Gate. But mostly justice!~
@45933 = ~There's more k-kicking left to be d-done.~
@45934 = ~Will you never tire of that meaningless title?~
@45935 = ~It is hardly meaningless. It was a well-earned recognition of the good <CHARNAME> did this city in ending Sarevok's iron crisis.~
@45936 = ~I agree. My blade is thirsty. It is past time we turned this safe house into a charnel house.~
@45937 = ~"There's some people I've never met. You know what, I think I'll butcher the lot of them." Who thinks like that? I mean, really?~
@45938 = ~One who knows his role in this game we play.~
@45939 = ~You just seemed—elsewhere. The last thing you want down here is your mind wandering. Not that anyone could blame you, considering what you've been through.~
@45940 = ~It's not been easy; I'm still recovering from my battle with Sarevok. Many unsettling truths were revealed.~
@45941 = ~Confronting Sarevok and his allies took much from me.~
@45942 = ~Tell me again what we're doing in this godsforsaken crypt.~
@45943 = ~I will explain it—I have had all I can stand of THIS monkey's voice. Sarevok's collaborator, Korlasz, has taken refuge in this tomb. The Grand Dukes have tasked us with eliminating her. That is what we are doing in this godsforsaken place, and I for one would see our business done sooner than later, that we may take our leave of it.~
@45944 = ~Not as much as it took out of them.~
@45945 = ~You know what's happening here, <CHARNAME>. The Flaming Fist believes the last of Sarevok's allies, Korlasz, is holed up in this tomb. The Council of Four want her dealt with.~

@45953 = ~Watch thyself, woman. Minsc is a kind and gentle soul. I am not so forgiving.~
@45954 = ~I like the attitude.~
@45955 = ~So are you ready to do this? To end Sarevok's legacy once and for all?~
@45956 = ~More than ready.~
@45957 = ~Yeah, I'll do that, but first let's go over exactly what's going on here one more time.~
@45958 = ~I've been ending Sarevok's legacy once and for all for the last three months, and somehow yet another of his followers the Grand Dukes want eliminated always manages to appear inside a fortnight.~
@45959 = ~Sarevok's servants shall fall before me, as he did.~
@45960 = ~Really, <CHARNAME>? A sieve holds more water than your mind does anything of value.~
@45961 = ~You really mean to take me into this place? Surely, you jest.~

The last thing you need in a place like this is someone holding you back. Go, take care of this Korlasz. I'll be here with Atrantis and the boys when you return.~
@45974 = ~I disagree. But I'll not argue the matter. If you don't wish to endanger your life, I'm hardly going to push you to do otherwise.~
@45975 = ~You have other skills beyond magic.~
@45976 = ~Training with Jannath is a waste of time. You have other abilities, far more useful than any precious cantrip you might learn from her.~
@45977 = ~Yeah, but I haven't had much call to be sneaky these past months. I'm rusty. The last thing you need in a place like this is someone holding you back.~
@45978 = ~You go, take care of this Korlasz. I'll be here with the Fist when you return. Take care of yourself, <CHARNAME>.~
@45979 = ~Very well.~
@45980 = ~There's no sense in you hanging around here. Go see if you can find Duke Jannath. I like your company, Imoen. I would see you develop your magical abilities to the point that you are comfortable accompanying me in places like this once again.~
@45981 = ~Don't bother waiting for me. I'll see you at the Ducal Palace.~
@45982 = ~Take care of yourself, <CHARNAME>.~
@45983 = ~Then command me to stay here with Atrantis for I'll not be joining you in there. I just— You know I've been studying magic under Liia Jannath. I'm starting to get the hang of it. But I'm not GOOD at it yet—not good enough to help you here.~
@45984 = ~The last thing you need in a place like this is someone holding you back. You go, take care of this Korlasz. I'll be waiting here for you when you're done.~

@45994 = ~Their l-loyalty is ad-ad-admirable, if nothing e-else.~
@45995 = ~Korlasz doubtlessly knows we are here now. We must move quickly.~

@46003 = ~You slew our fellows? Then pay the price!~
@46004 = ~...I'm listening.~
@46005 = ~I slew Sarevok—he gave me no choice. Do you care for life so little that you'd throw yours away, as he did?~
@46006 = ~Look at you—living like rats in this home of the dead. You served Sarevok well and this is your reward? No. You have given your murderous master too much already. Don't sacrifice what might yet be a long and productive life, not on his account.~
@46007 = ~Sarevok is dead—you gain nothing serving him now but can lose so very much. Surrender, please, I beseech thee. End this madness.~
@46008 = ~A good start. Now put down your weapons and, on my honor, you'll live to see another day dawn.~
@46009 = ~I don't want you to listen, fool. I want you to die.~
@46010 = ~If we must die, we'll not do it alone! ~

@46037 = ~Hobgoblin slavers came to my house—they cut my mother and father down before my eyes. I tried to escape, but they ran me down like a pack of wolves on a wounded rabbit. I could not escape. They—they sold me. I've been here ever since. ~

@46057 = ~Take care, <PRO_SIRMAAM>! She's more dangerous than you know.~

@46073 = ~Perhaps you should be the one who opens it.~
@46074 = ~What? I can't—I'm just a child! ~
@46075 = ~Yes—a child who tried to get me to open a trapped sarcophagus.~
@46076 = ~You can't? Or you won't?~

@46125 = ~You do protest too much, <CHARNAME>. What reason could you have for returning her other than to take your reward? Do you like the company of the undead? Now that I think of it, that would actually explain a few things...~

@46135 = ~I would have surrendered myself for a cell. I'll not accept death so easily.~ [BD46135]

@46143 = ~The consequence is that an enemy is dead. I can live with it.~
@46144 = ~I think I just did.~
@46145 = ~It wasn't right, <CHARNAME>. It simply wasn't right.~
@46146 = ~A convenient rationalization.~

@46151 = ~Unnecessary, but highly entertaining.~

@46158 = ~Well, there's no honor in me, so that actually works out.~
@46159 = ~You would have me spare the life of an enemy? No. She had to die.~
@46160 = ~Something is honorable or it is not. In this, there can be no debate.~
@46161 = ~It is more than distasteful. It is intolerable. Thou shouldst not have done this thing.~
@46162 = ~Thou shouldst not make a jest of matters such as this. I would not see more lives lost on Sarevok's account—or thine.~
@46163 = ~<CHARNAME> is correct. There can be no mercy for those who stand in our way.~
@46164 = ~Perhaps thou'rt right. But I prefer to believe there is another, a better way. Would that thou could see it too.~
@46165 = ~Th-that was unnec—unnecessary, <CHARNAME>. Korlasz was a def-defeated woman. There w-was no call to c-cut her down. ~
@46166 = ~This is grim business, <CHARNAME>. Boo says you walk a path of darkness, and he is right. This place could use a few more torches. ~
@46167 = ~Okay. I'm good. Good. I'm good. ~
@46168 = ~Let us leave the dead in peace, <CHARNAME>. Nothing good can come from this place. ~
@46169 = ~Let us see what gifts these corpses have to offer.~
@46170 = ~This is no place for the likes of us. Let us begone from it immediately. ~
@46171 = ~We have what we came for, <CHARNAME>. Korlasz has been defeated. Why do we continue to disturb the dead? ~
@46172 = ~I-I-I'm not sure we sh-should be here... ~
@46173 = ~Well? Is someone going to loot those sarcophagi, or my I do everything myself? ~
@46174 = ~A suitably grim end to this evening's entertainment. Well, <CHARNAME>? What should we do?~
@46175 = ~After all we've encountered down here, you cannot seriously mean to tempt the fates to punish us further...~
@46176 = ~When this is all over, I'm sure I'll look back on this all and laugh. Eventually. ~
@46177 = ~Boo says let the sleeping men lie. They'll bite worse than any dog. ~
@46178 = ~Iiiiaaahh! Kill the intruders!~
@46179 = ~Death to the living!~
@46180 = ~Silence them, now and forever!~
@46181 = ~Life is chaos; death is order!~
@46182 = ~Listen. Do you hear it? ~
@46183 = ~I hear nothing.~
@46184 = ~Your hearing must be better than mine. Seems quiet as a tomb in here.~
@46185 = ~What nonsense is this? There is nothing to hear.~
@46186 = ~Exactly. Glorious silence.~
@46187 = ~I shall return to my slumber, but first, I promised you a reward. Here it is. Now go. There is nothing more here, not for the living.~
@46188 = ~Now go. There is nothing more here, not for the living.~
@46189 = ~There is nothing here, naught but golden silence.~
@46190 = ~Are you done? ~
@46191 = ~Imoen? I thought you were going to remain with the Fist.~
@46192 = ~Gods, I hope so. I can't wait to be out of this wretched mausoleum.~
@46193 = ~Aye, though you were little enough help.~
@46194 = ~Changed my mind.~
@46195 = ~DIE!~
@46196 = ~That is not Imoen—'tis a doppelganger!~
@46197 = ~Let's be on our way, then.~
@46198 = ~You should never have turned your back on me, fool!~
@46199 = ~Another doppelganger. Am I the only one who hates these things?~
@46200 = ~Finished? ~
@46201 = ~Imoen? What are you doing here? You should be with the Fist—you certainly shouldn't be alone with this villain.~
@46202 = ~Korlasz. You agreed to surrender yourself to the Flaming Fist. Is this how you honor your promises?~
@46203 = ~What is the meaning of this? You should be with the Flaming Fist—both of you.~
@46204 = ~You wound me. ~
@46205 = ~I am the wounded party, my lady. I took you at your word. You said you would surrender to the Fist.~
@46206 = ~Imoen, what's going on here?~
@46207 = ~I'll do worse than that if you don't surrender to the Fist beyond yon door.~
@46208 = ~You'll try.~
@46209 = ~I'll wear your face to freedom—DIE!~
@46210 = ~ 'Tis a doppelganger! Kill it!~
@46211 = ~I thought my forces were defeated. When new information presented itself, I reconsidered my position.~
@46212 = ~We'll deal with them in short order, I assure you. Right after we're finished with you.~
@46213 = ~It's all right. Everything will be fine...~
@46214 = ~Finished? ~
@46215 = ~Korlasz is dead.~
@46216 = ~Ask the mage. Ho, Korlasz! Am I finished here?~
@46217 = ~I sent a young girl I found in the tombs in your direction. Did she get here?~
@46218 = ~You've done what you came to do. Waste your time further in this house of the dead if that's your desire. It matters little to me now.~
@46219 = ~Korlasz was the last of Sarevok's allies. His legacy has been ground to dust. Baldur's Gate owes you a greater debt than we can ever repay.~
@46220 = ~I did what any <PRO_MANWOMAN> would when faced with Sarevok's evil—nothing more or less.~
@46221 = ~Don't let that stop you from trying.~
@46222 = ~True.~
@46223 = ~A child? No, we've seen nothing like that. ~
@46224 = ~Ah, I should have seen it before. She must have been the doppelganger. Never mind.~
@46225 = ~You didn't see her? How is that possible?~
@46226 = ~You must have seen her. There's no other way she could have gone.~
@46227 = ~She is lost, then, or found her own way to escape. Either way, it's no concern of mine.~
@46228 = ~There was a doppelganger in there? Bloody hells. I hate those things.~
@46229 = ~I can tell you nothing but what we saw, and we saw no child.~
@46230 = ~Shall we return to the Ducal Palace?~
@46231 = ~I'll continue looking around.~
@46232 = ~I'm done with this place.~
@46233 = ~As you wish. When you're ready to leave, we'll be here.~
@46234 = ~Tell it to the Grand Dukes. They're the ones with the deep pockets.~
@46235 = ~It'd be nice to think so, but if you believe the average man or woman would have defied Sarevok, you're fooling yourself.~
@46236 = ~Good. The streets are crowded and dangerous right now, but I'd still rather be up there than down here.~
@46237 = ~As you wish.~
@46238 = ~This place gives me chills. That Sarevok's allies would seek refuge here is no surprise.~
@46239 = ~We shouldn't tarry long in this place. Those entombed here have suffered enough intrusion.~
@46240 = ~It's over, <CHARNAME>. It's finally over. Sarevok's allies are all dead or awaiting the noose. What will you do now? ~ [BD46240]
@46241 = ~Whatever the city and the Sword Coast require of me.~
@46242 = ~First I'm going to sleep for a week. Then another week. Then a month. After that, I'll probably have a nap.~
@46243 = ~I'm going to Waterdeep!~
@46244 = ~What I have always done: Seek new ways to expand my power.~
@46245 = ~Really? ~ [BD46245]
@46246 = ~No, not really. I don't know what I'm going to do. Do you?~
@46247 = ~Why not?~
@46248 = ~I'm glad you're all right, <CHARNAME>. I worry about you. ~ [BD46248]
@46249 = ~I worry about you too. If I were to lose you... I don't know what I'd do.~
@46250 = ~I'm glad I'm all right, too. I also worry about me.~
@46251 = ~You waste time and energy with needless concern. I can take care of myself.~
@46252 = ~I'm going to keep studying magic with Duke Jannath. I'm starting to get—well, not good at it—but better than I was.~ [BD46252]
@46253 = ~Why not, indeed? Though that'd mean we have to part.~ [BD46253]
@46254 = ~You sure are a ray of sunshine, aren't you?~ [BD46254]
@46255 = ~Can't you take anything seriously?~ [BD46255]
@46256 = ~Perhaps, though I hope I never have to.~
@46257 = ~Why on Toril would I want to?~
@46258 = ~This is a world of absurdity. There is nothing in it worth taking seriously, and if there were, it's not something I'd care to encounter.~
@46259 = ~I don't know why I talk to you sometimes. I really don't.~ [BD46259]
@46260 = ~Let's never find out, all right?~ [BD46260]
