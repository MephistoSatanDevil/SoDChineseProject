@39502 = ~It makes perfect sense. The logic is inescapable, the proof irrefutable.~
@39503 = ~Rise. It is time.~
@39504 = ~You know what you must do. Embrace the darkness that flows within you.~
@39505 = ~Take the dagger. Kill her.~
@39506 = ~Take it.~
@39507 = ~Even now, you resist. You are more powerful than I thought.~
@39508 = ~No matter. In truth, all I require is your presence.~
@39509 = ~You will have no allies now. No friends to save you. You will be cast out, as all who threaten the natural order are cast out.~
@39510 = ~And when you are cast out, we will meet again.~
@39511 = ~You are lost. Follow my voice. Come back to me. ~
@39512 = ~What happened? What did you see? ~
@39513 = ~I saw Skie Silvershield die. I saw the face of her killer.~
@39514 = ~You set me up. You killed Skie Silvershield.~
@39515 = ~I saw your death.~
@39516 = ~So you know the truth—despite my efforts, you remember. Most impressive. A pity it will not protect you from the justice of the Grand Dukes. ~
@39517 = ~Nor will it protect you from MY justice.~
@39518 = ~The truth will come out. Maybe not today or tomorrow, perhaps not in my lifetime—probably not in my lifetime, considering how abbreviated it's likely to be. But somehow, someday, you will pay for what you've done.~
@39519 = ~I'll find a way out of here. And when I do, I'll find you. The day is coming, fiend. Your end is nearer than you know.~
@39520 = ~There are few more acutely aware of their own vulnerability than I.~
@39521 = ~I hope you do escape this place. There is much we could accomplish together. Farewell.~
@39522 = ~Tell me more.~
@39523 = ~You killed Skie Silvershield. I won't let you get away with it.~
@39524 = ~I'll do you one better than that. When the time comes, I'll show you, you traitorous bastard!~
@39525 = ~I saw you die, screaming, at my hand. I saw myself look down on your corpse, and laugh, for my vengeance was complete. You had paid for your crimes against me—paid for Skie's murder with your own wretched life!~
@39526 = ~Am I supposed to fear your justice? I've taken greater liberties with beings of greater power than you. Your words are nothing but the hollow bravado of the doomed.~
@39527 = ~Perhaps you are right. Perhaps not. There are some truths only time can tell. Farewell. I fear we shall not meet again.~
@39528 = ~Hey—hey, wake up. Wake up and move your arse while you've still got an arse to move.~ [BD39528]

@39534 = ~I'm not going anywhere.~
@39535 = ~This is your time, is it? How do you figure that?~
@39536 = ~Don't matter. What matters is the bag o' gold your friend Imoen gave me to get you outta here, and the four other bags o' gold she's givin' me when I pull it off.~ [BD39536]
@39537 = ~Imoen sent you? Where is she?~
@39538 = ~FIVE bags of gold? I hope she doesn't expect me to pay her back.~
@39539 = ~You will succeed. I'll not die in this wretched hole.~
@39540 = ~I just said that, didn't I? ~
@39541 = ~Where is she?~
@39542 = ~How do I know you're telling the truth?~
@39543 = ~This is a jailbreak, then? Running away isn't my style.~
@39544 = ~A jailbreak, that's what's goin' on. Yer friend Imoen's payin' me t' get you out o' here. And quite handsomely, I might add. C'mon, we gotta move. Yer stuff—whatever the stickier Fists haven't purloined—is on a table in the central chamber.~ [BD39544]
@39545 = ~C'mon, we gotta move.~
@39546 = ~Is getting cut down by Entar Silvershield yer style? Cuz that's the only Plan B you've got. C'mon, we gotta move.~ [BD39546]
@39547 = ~You know who says that? Everyone that's ever been accused of a crime ever. It won't save yer neck. C'mon, we gotta move. Yer stuff—what the stickier Fists haven't made off with—is on a table in the central chamber.~ [BD39547]
@39548 = ~Oh, you're goin' somewhere. Yer friend Imoen's payin' me t' get you out o' here, and quite handsomely, I might add. You wanna live, you'll come with me now. Move it!~
@39549 = ~The girl's waitin' fer ya, 'long with my gold. So let's go!~ [BD39549]
@39550 = ~My time, your time, whoever's time it is, we don't got much of it. Yer friend Imoen's payin' me t' get you out o' here, and quite handsomely, I might add. You wanna live, you'll come with me now. Move it!~ [BD39550]
@39551 = ~Take it up with her, AFTER I've been paid. Let's go! Yer things're in the central chamber. You can pick 'em up on the way out.~ [BD39551]
@39552 = ~How do you—? You want out o' this place or not?~ [BD39552]
@39553 = ~I do.~
@39554 = ~I don't need to get out. I'm innocent.~
@39555 = ~You would have me flee? Running away isn't my style.~

@39557 = ~Guards! Guards! The slayer of Silvershield has escaped!~
@39558 = ~I didn't do it either, hero! Don't leave me here! DON'T LEAVE ME HERE!~
@39559 = ~Sure, good, that's just great—run away, leave the rest of us here to rot.~
@39560 = ~Ya can't go out that way. Well, you can, but only in chains, an' I doubt you'd live long after. Follow me.~
@39561 = ~Well, you can, but only in chains an' I doubt you'd live long once you went through. Follow me.~
@39562 = ~Over here. You can get out through the basement. ~ [BD39562]
@39563 = ~What happened to the guards?~
@39564 = ~Wait, slow down. Who ARE you?~
@39565 = ~And then what?~
@39566 = ~They came down with a severe case o' slit throat. Come on, let's get outta here.~ [BD39566]
@39567 = ~I'm the guy try'na save yer arse, and you aren't making it easy. Move it!~
@39568 = ~Then we escape and you get to see yer girlie again.~
@39569 = ~We are not involved; Imoen is like a sister to me. It would be too strange.~
@39570 = ~You think Imoen and I are lovers? Where'd you get that from?~
@39571 = ~Imoen and I are friends, nothing more. I'd rather we weren't even that, as often as not.~
@39572 = ~That's fascinating, it really and truly is. Can we leave now, please?~ [BD39572]
@39573 = ~Whatever she is to you, if you ever wanna see her again, get into the basement.~
@39574 = ~Someone's gonna realize ye're gone an' then we'll be done for. Get movin'!~
@39575 = ~Are you sure it was Imoen who hired you?~
@39576 = ~This doesn't add up. Something here doesn't make sense...~
@39577 = ~I'll move when I'm ready. Now be silent.~
@39578 = ~The only thing doesn't make sense here is I'm offerin' you a way out of this hellhole and you're dawdling around admirin' the decor. When ye're ready t'go, come find me.~
@39579 = ~Awright, Yer Highness. I'll await yer pleasure down in the basement then, shall I? Bloody hells. Ya try an' help someone an' this is the thanks you get...~
@39580 = ~Bloody hells. You try an' help someone an' this is the thanks you get...~
@39581 = ~The only thing I'm sure of right this second is that the longer we fiddle around here, the less likely it is I'm gonna get paid. Now come on!~
@39582 = ~Through here. ~ [BD39582]
@39583 = ~Where does this go?~
@39584 = ~A secret exit in the basement of the Flaming Fist's headquarters? Gods, I love this city...~
@39585 = ~Enough! I'll not be herded about like some mindless farm animal.~
@39586 = ~The sewers. When you get down, there's a waterfall to the east. Under it, there's a lake in a cavern. Imoen'll be waitin' for you at the cave entrance. Got it? Good.~ [BD39586]
@39587 = ~Well, the city don't love you no more. Now listen: When ya get down, there's a waterfall to the east, flows down into a lake in a cavern. You'll find Imoen near the entrance.~ [BD39587]
@39588 = ~Then stick around an' get slaughtered like one. Your choice.~
@39589 = ~Now go, quickly!~
@39590 = ~Using the sewers to escape justice might have worked for Sarevok, murderer, but you'll not be so lucky.~
@39591 = ~I am no murderer. I don't want to fight you.~
@39592 = ~You want to fight a murderer in a confined space? In what world does that make any kind of sense?~
@39593 = ~Save your breath, fool. It will be your last.~
@39594 = ~I'll give you this, traitor—you've chosen a fit place to die!~
@39595 = ~Please! I'm innocent; you must believe me!~
@39596 = ~Would you be so kind as to point me in a way that does have an escape?~
@39597 = ~Words won't stop me. What else have you got?~
@39598 = ~For Skie Silvershield—DIE!~
@39599 = ~Your glib tongue won't save you. For Skie Silvershield—DIE!~
@39600 = ~You dare plead innocence? I'll not hear your lies. For Skie Silvershield—DIE!~
@39601 = ~Crawling through others' leavings to escape Baldur's Gate justice? You really are no different from Sarevok, are you?~
@39602 = ~Justice for Silvershield! Die! ~
@39603 = ~I'll have your head off, you scum! ~
@39604 = ~There's no escape for you. ~
@39605 = ~Lord Eltan's ordered your death—accept your fate! ~
@39606 = ~I'll see you dead, monster!~
@39607 = ~Silvershield will pay handsomely for the head of his daughter's killer. ~
@39608 = ~No one escapes the Flaming Fist! ~
@39609 = ~This is for Skie Silvershield! ~
@39610 = ~Surrender and I'll end you quick.~
@39611 = ~You betrayed us! You betrayed all of Baldur's Gate! Die, "hero"!~
@39612 = ~No escape for you, scum. The only place you're going is a cell—or your grave!~
@39613 = ~Hands in the air. Get away from the opening.~ [BD39613]
@39614 = ~I don't want to fight you, Corwin. I'm INNOCENT. You have to believe me!~
@39615 = ~Schael, please, I beg you, don't do this. I love you.~
@39616 = ~You would prevent my escape? I thought we had something, you and I.~
@39617 = ~After all we've been through, this is what it comes to. I should have known you'd betray me in the end.~
@39618 = ~Don't try to stop me, Corwin. I need to get out of here if I'm to have any chance of proving my innocence.~
@39619 = ~And if I don't, what will you do? Cut me down? Is that any worse than what I can expect from Entar Silvershield?~
@39620 = ~You think I want to do this? You think this isn't killing me? We should be together in my bedchamber or a meadow under a cloudless blue sky—ANYWHERE but here!~ [BD39620]
@39621 = ~But here we are. I have a job to do. You know me. You know I can't let you go.~ [BD39621]
@39622 = ~This is madness. I tell you I'm INNOCENT. You have to believe me!~
@39623 = ~I know who murdered Skie. Come with me. Help me find him.~
@39624 = ~You know what I'm capable of, Corwin. Please, don't try to stop me.~
@39625 = ~Rohma's already lost a father. Don't make her lose a mother too.~
@39626 = ~You'd have me turn my back on the Fist? On my family?~ [BD39626]
@39627 = ~I hoped to talk you out of this madness, but I see words alone won't get this job done. All right then. Let's go.~ [BD39627]
@39628 = ~Let's go.~
@39629 = ~Under the circumstances, I wouldn't be so quick to assume.~
@39630 = ~This is madness. I tell you I'm INNOCENT. You have to believe me!~
@39631 = ~I didn't do it. You must know that.~
@39632 = ~I need to go past you—it's my only way out of here. Please, don't try to stop me. You know what I'm capable of.~
@39633 = ~Think about Rohma, Corwin. She's already lost a father. Don't make her lose a mother too.~
@39634 = ~I know what I saw. You were standing over the body of Skie Silvershield. Duke Entar's daughter. His DAUGHTER.~ [BD39634]
@39635 = ~Ah. I understand now. This is about Rohma.~
@39636 = ~Do you truly believe me so mad that I would, that I could even be capable of doing this thing I'm accused of? Do you truly think so little of me?~
@39637 = ~And how many people have you slain, Corwin? Everyone is someone's child.~
@39638 = ~I'm not going to argue with you, Captain. I will, however, kill you, if you don't get out of my way.~
@39639 = ~Have I killed before? Yes—but never a defenseless girl. Never in cold blood. Never without cause. Don't give me cause now. Surrender.~ [BD39639]
@39640 = ~Don't give me cause now, <CHARNAME>. Please. Surrender.~
@39641 = ~...Very well. I didn't kill Skie Silvershield, whatever you may believe. But I'll not make an orphan of your daughter.~
@39642 = ~I don't WANT to fight you, but I will, if you make me.~
@39643 = ~Never. Not while this body still draws breath.~
@39644 = ~Don't bring her into this. You won't like where that ends.~ [BD39644]
@39645 = ~I've done things I regret in my life, Schael. Making an orphan of Rohma won't be one of them. I surrender.~
@39646 = ~Listen, just listen to me, please. Do you truly believe me so mad that I would, that I could even be capable of doing this thing I'm accused of? Do you truly think so little of me?~
@39647 = ~Rohma's already lost one parent, Captain Corwin. Don't let your pride cost her another.~
@39648 = ~It's the right thing to do. On your knees. Hands behind your head.~
@39649 = ~I know EXACTLY what you're capable of. I've seen it. Now put your hands behind your head and get on your knees or by the gods I swear I will put you down.~ [BD39649]
@39650 = ~If that's the only way to end this... Very well. I didn't kill Skie Silvershield. I'll not have your death on my conscience.~
@39651 = ~I don't WANT to fight you, Corwin. But I will, if you make me. If you make me, I will kill you.~
@39652 = ~Not while I still draw breath.~
@39653 = ~Even if that's true, running away won't put anything right. ~
@39654 = ~You're right. I know it.~
@39655 = ~It might stop things getting worse. For a time, at least.~
@39656 = ~It can scarcely make things worse.~
@39657 = ~Do you have any idea what you've done? Any clue how much chaos the Silvershield murder has caused? The city's tearing itself apart because of you. It has to stop. It HAS to.~
@39658 = ~The city's tearing itself apart. It has to stop. It HAS to. And it won't until someone pays for what happened at Dragonspear. If you know anything about me, anything at all, you know I can't let you go.~ [BD39658]
@39659 = ~Very well. For the sake of the city that once called me hero, I surrender.~
@39660 = ~This is madness. I tell you I'm INNOCENT. You have to believe me!~
@39661 = ~You know what I'm capable of, Corwin. Please, don't try to stop me.~
@39662 = ~Rohma's already lost a father, Captain Corwin. Would you have her lose a mother too?~
@39663 = ~Then you surrender? ~
@39664 = ~If that's the only way to end this... Yes. I surrender.~
@39665 = ~I don't WANT to fight you, Corwin. Please don't make me. Please.~
@39666 = ~That will never happen.~
@39667 = ~Damn you, <CHARNAME>...! All right, then. Let's go.~ [BD39667]
@39668 = ~You threaten my daughter, <CHARNAME>? You just made your last mistake. Take <PRO_HIMHER>!~ [BD39668]
@39669 = ~It has to stop. It HAS to. And that won't happen until you answer for Skie. Now get on your knees, hands behind your head. Do it. ~ [BD39669]
@39670 = ~If that's the only way to end this... Very well. I surrender. I didn't kill Skie Silvershield. I'll not kill you.~
@39671 = ~I don't WANT to fight you, but I will, if you make me. Don't do this. ~
@39672 = ~Think about your family, Captain. Think of Rohma. Walk away from this; leave me to deal with these others. No one ever has to know.~
@39673 = ~What I believe doesn't matter anymore. You tried to escape. And now we have to do what we must. Let's go.~ [BD39673]
@39674 = ~Thank the gods... On your knees, hands behind your head.~ [BD39674]
@39675 = ~No—no! It's not enough. She has to die! Die in the name of Skie Silvershield! Kill her!~ [BD39675]
@39676 = ~Damn it, Duncan! Run, <CHARNAME>! The cavern beyond the opening will get you out of the city! Go!~
@39677 = ~It's over, <CHARNAME>. There's no way out of this. ~
@39678 = ~I didn't do it, Duncan. I didn't kill the girl.~
@39679 = ~There's always a way out. Right now you're standing in front of mine.~
@39680 = ~I can go past you or through you. Which would you prefer?~
@39681 = ~It's over, <CHARNAME>. Come away from the edge of the falls. You'll find nothing but death beyond them.~ [BD39681]
@39682 = ~You've got to let me go, Duncan. I know who murdered Skie now. I need to find him.~
@39683 = ~Skie Silvershield is dead, much as I'd wish it otherwise. Are you really so eager to join her?~
@39684 = ~And that is worse than what awaits me on this side of it?~
@39685 = ~No. But on this side, you die at MY hand. Cut her down! For Grand Duke Silvershield and the Flaming Fist!~ [BD39685]
@39686 = ~But I liked her, in spite of all that. She deserved better than what she got from you. Schael Corwin deserved better too.~
@39687 = ~As it pleases you, so long as you DO die. Take her! Death to the enemies of Baldur's Gate!~ [BD39687]
@39688 = ~Of course you'd say that.~
@39689 = ~This is about more than a girl now. Half the city wants you drawn and quartered; the other is ready to revolt on your behalf. Baldur's Gate survived Sarevok, the iron crisis, and Caelar's crusade... I'll not let it fall on your account.~ [BD39689]
@39690 = ~I would die for this city—I nearly have more times than I care to count. But I won't die for a crime I didn't commit.~
@39691 = ~The city's bigger than any one <PRO_MANWOMAN>. It will survive this. So will I.~
@39692 = ~You'll not live long enough to see what happens either way, fool.~
@39693 = ~You're half right.~ [BD39693]
@39694 = ~Here's an action for you—!~
@39695 = ~If you won't go back, you WILL go down.~
@39696 = ~We'll see about that soon enough! Cut him down! Let him feel the wrath of the Flaming Fist!~ [BD39696]
@39697 = ~Heya! Over here! ~
@39698 = ~You made it! That's great, I was—I was scared you wouldn't. ~ [BD39698]
@39699 = ~It is good to see you again, Imoen.~
@39700 = ~You and me both.~
@39701 = ~You should never have doubted I would find a way to freedom. I never did.~
@39702 = ~I wanted to visit you in jail, but they wouldn't even let me through the door. I thought you were done for.~ [BD39702]
@39703 = ~I'm so sorry, <CHARNAME>. I should never have let you go to Dragonspear without me.~ [BD39703]
@39704 = ~I missed you too. More than you know.~
@39705 = ~I'm glad you weren't there, Imoen. Some of the things I saw will haunt me the rest of my days.~
@39706 = ~You make it sound as though you could stop me.~
@39707 = ~But if I'd been there, maybe, I don't know—maybe things would've been different.~ [BD39707]
@39708 = ~Well, we're together again now, and that's the way it's going to stay. I'm not letting you out of my sight ever again. Come on, let's get a move on. It's only a matter of time before the Flaming Fist figures out where you are.~ [BD39708]
@39709 = ~We should get moving. It's only a matter of time before the Flaming Fist figures out where you are.~
@39710 = ~Boy, <CHARNAME>! Do you have to take every little thing as a personal affront? Come on, let's get a move on. It's only a matter of time before the Flaming Fist figures out where you are.~ [BD39710]
@39711 = ~Rejoice, Boo! Our friends have returned to us!~ [BD39711]
@39712 = ~But people have said one of our friends has been up to no good...~ [BD39712]
@39713 = ~I never thought I'd see thee again, <CHARNAME>. Knowing what I know, I would have preferred it that way. Thou art lucky to have a supporter as passionate as Imoen.~ [BD39713]
@39714 = ~Were it not for her, neither I nor Minsc would deign to look upon thee, never mind assist thee in escaping justice.~ [BD39714]
@39715 = ~So Imoen's hireling told it true. You have escaped the Fist and Silvershield's justice—for the moment. I promised Gorion to watch over and protect you. Your actions make me question that promise. ~
@39716 = ~Do not th-think I'm pleased to be here, <CHARNAME>. What I do, I do for Gorion and Imoen. If you did indeed murder Skie Silvershield, you will answer for it.~ [BD39716]
@39717 = ~Could we maybe talk about this someplace, you know—far away from here?~ [BD39717]
@39718 = ~Before we do that, I need to thank you, all of you, for, if not believing in me, at least supporting me in my hour of need. Especially you, Imoen. If you hadn't arranged my escape, I'd still be languishing in that cell.~
@39719 = ~Before we do that, I need to thank both of you for believing in me. Especially you, Imoen. If you hadn't arranged my escape, I'd still be languishing in that cell.~
@39720 = ~You go to all the effort to have me sprung me from the Fist's headquarters, and you don't include transportation in the plan? Bad form, Imoen. Bad form.~
@39721 = ~Agreed. Let's waste no more time in this place.~
@39722 = ~You think I got you out? ~
@39723 = ~You didn't?~
@39724 = ~The man who freed me said as much.~
@39725 = ~That is what I was told.~
@39726 = ~You think I got you out? No, no, no. A message came to the Ducal Palace, telling me where and when to meet you. I thought it was some scheme of yours.~ [BD39726]
@39727 = ~Most strange. And not a little disturbing.~
@39728 = ~I WISH I had such foresight.~
@39729 = ~Someone is manipulating me. When I find out who, they'll regret it.~
@39730 = ~Forward!~ [BD39730]
@39731 = ~You should not make light of the effort Imoen has made on your behalf.~
@39732 = ~Wait. Wait wait wait.~ [BD39732]
@39733 = ~Imoen? 'Twas thou who contrived to free our friend?~ [BD39733]
@39734 = ~You cannot believe everything you hear. Isn't that right, Boo?~
@39735 = ~Someone told you I was behind your breakout?~
@39736 = ~Less disturbing than being caught and imprisoned once again though, no?~ [BD39736]
@39737 = ~We can figure this out later. For now we need to just keep moving. Forward!~ [BD39737]
@39738 = ~There are worse things you could be tricked into than escaping a cell, Minsc thinks.~ [BD39738]
@39739 = ~Someone is playing games with us.~
@39740 = ~但—但—但是谁？~ [BD39740]
@39741 = ~Heya, everyone! I got 'em! ~ [BD39741]
@39742 = ~Rejoice, Boo! Our friends have returned to us!~ [BD39742]
@39743 = ~But one of our friends has been very, very naughty...~ [BD39743]
@39744 = ~I never thought I'd see thee again, <CHARNAME>. Knowing what I know, I would have preferred it that way. Thou art lucky to have a supporter as passionate as Imoen.~ [BD39744]
@39745 = ~Were it not for her, neither I nor Minsc would deign to look upon thee, never mind assist thee in escaping justice.~ [BD39745]
@39746 = ~So Imoen's hireling told it true. You have escaped the Fist and Silvershield's justice, <CHARNAME>—for the moment. I promised to watch over and protect you. Your actions make me regret that promise.~
@39747 = ~D-do not th-think I'm pleased to be here, <CHARNAME>. What I do, I do for Gorion and Imoen. If you did indeed murder Skie Silvershield, you will answer for it.~ [BD39747]
@39748 = ~Can we talk about this somewhere, you know, far away from here? Please?~ [BD39748]
@39749 = ~Before we go, I must speak. I have done terrible things in my time, I'll not deny it. Killing Skie Silvershield is not one of them. Whether you believe that or not, I thank you all for being here. Especially you, Imoen.~
@39750 = ~Before we go, I must speak. I have done terrible things in my time, I'll not deny it. Killing Skie Silvershield is not one of them. Whether you believe that or not, I thank you both for being here. Especially you, Imoen.~
@39751 = ~We don't have time to waste. Imoen, when you plotted my escape, did you arrange for transportation?~
@39752 = ~You can believe what you will. You have abetted my escape. The Fist won't look kindly on that.~
@39753 = ~Me? Why me? ~ [BD39753]
@39754 = ~For arranging my escape, of course.~
@39755 = ~You nearly died because of me. Yet you remain steadfast in supporting me, organizing my escape from the Fist. I don't deserve to have you in my life, but I'm grateful you are.~
@39756 = ~You sent my liberator to see me free, did you not?~
@39757 = ~Imoen? 'Twas thou who contrived to free our friend?~ [BD39757]
@39758 = ~No. A message came to the Ducal Palace, telling me where and when to meet you. I figured it was some scheme of yours.~ [BD39758]
@39759 = ~Strange. And more than a little disturbing.~
@39760 = ~I WISH I had such foresight.~
@39761 = ~Who sent you this message?~
@39762 = ~I am being manipulated. When I learn who's behind this, they'll regret it.~
@39763 = ~Wait, you think I set up your breakout?~ [BD39763]
@39764 = ~We've not aided you yet. We would none of us be here were it not for Imoen's pleas.~
@39765 = ~I don't want them to help because they have to. I want them to help because they want to.~ [BD39765]
@39766 = ~That is too much to ask from those who see what they think they've seen. In time, I will prove my innocence. For now, we must away from here.~
@39767 = ~I'll take their help however I can get it. Did you arrange for transportation when you planned my escape?~
@39768 = ~I've neither the time nor the inclination to make my case here. They will see their error eventually.~
@39769 = ~A band of outlaws, on the run! Find Minsc a rich man to rob, that I may feed the poor!~ [BD39769]
@39770 = ~Perhaps we will—IF an error we have indeed made. Which I doubt.~
@39771 = ~All right. Let's get going.~ [BD39771]
@39772 = ~Imoen? You didn't mention you were involved in the escape. I d-d-don't know how I feel about this.~ [BD39772]
@39773 = ~I know how I feel about it. Were it not for Gorion, I'd let Silvershield have you.~
@39774 = ~We can figure this out later. The Fist will come looking for us soon. We should get out of here before they do.~ [BD39774]
@39775 = ~If thou didst, thou might have foreseen thy imprisonment and elected not to slaughter an innocent girl.~ [BD39775]
@39776 = ~Someone is playing games with us.~
@39777 = ~B-but who?~ [BD39777]
@39778 = ~I thought you did. Who else would know what you were planning? This WAS your plan, right?~ [BD39778]
@39779 = ~I'm pretty sure the Flaming Fist isn't on our trail. Can we take a break, just for a minute? ~ [BD39779]
@39780 = ~I th-th-think we could all use a... a rest.~ [BD39780]
@39781 = ~We've escaped for the moment, but we cannot run forever. How do you plan to answer the charges against you, <CHARNAME>? Your flight will do little to win you favor with the citizens of Baldur's Gate. ~
@39782 = ~Entar Silvershield has a l-long reach. It would be nice if we had some sort of, of, of p-plan to stay out of his grasp.~ [BD39782]
@39783 = ~Thou hast thy freedom. What wouldst thou have us do now?~ [BD39783]
@39784 = ~It's nights like this that make Minsc think of the day that came before them. What a day it was, eh, Boo? ~ [BD39784]
@39785 = ~I'm glad we're back together, <CHARNAME>. I was afraid I'd lost you. ~ [BD39785]
@39786 = ~Hey, do you feel a little... off?~ [BD39786]
@39787 = ~Now. ~
@39788 = ~Come to Minsc, shadowy men! And bring your shadowy butts, that I may kick them!~ [BD39788]
@39789 = ~What is this I feel...? Head is light—lighter than usual, even...~ [BD39789]
@39790 = ~All goes dark... Run, Boo... Run...~ [BD39790]
@39791 = ~The mist—it is more than mist, it dulls the senses...~ [BD39791]
@39792 = ~They are shadows... Can't see them properly...~ [BD39792]
@39793 = ~The world fades...~ [BD39793]
@39794 = ~Dynaheir! I will save you!~ [BD39794]
@39795 = ~Watch your backs! We have enemies on all sides!~
@39796 = ~I may fall this n-night, but I'll d-drag a few of you down with me!~
@39797 = ~Jaheira, my love! I will be with you, always!~
@39798 = ~Khalid, no! Please, I cannot lose you, not again...~
@39799 = ~Back! Back, you flapping vultures, get away from me!~
@39800 = ~I— What is this? What have you done to us?~
@39801 = ~Is this how it ends, then...?~
@39802 = ~JAHEIRA! My love! Be strong, I am with you!~
@39803 = ~C'mon, then. Show us what you've got.~
@39804 = ~What's going on? Fingers're tingly.~
@39805 = ~Ow. That's gotta hurt. Why doesn't that hurt?~
@39806 = ~Aw, hells. This is no good.~
@39807 = ~Does the child of Bhaal still live?~ [BD39807]
@39808 = ~They all do. For the moment.~ [BD39808]
@39809 = ~Load them onto the cart, quickly. I want us on the road south in no more than five minutes. Our client is anxious to have his prize.~ [BD39809]
@39810 = ~Our client is anxious to have his prize.~
@39811 = ~Justice for Silvershield! Death to the traitor!~
@39812 = ~Thrix is glad to hear it, though you should have let Thrix finish telling you the terms before agreeing. For if you lose the bet, Thrix the Profane will take your soul!~
@39813 = ~I am glad you think so, my friend. But I must admit I have misgivings over playing this devil's game at all...~ [BD39813]
@39814 = ~You won't part with the monk, eh? All right, then, who else is there for Thrix to take?~
@39815 = ~Your commitment to your friends is admirable, <CHARNAME>.~ [BD39815]
@39816 = ~A pity. Thrix thinks she would have made a worthy addition to his coterie. Who else is there? Let Thrix see...~
@39817 = ~You are wise to hold the mystic might of Odesseiron in such esteem. And you, devil—you would eat me? Thay's greatest son Edwin Odesseiron is too spicy a dish, even for you. Can a devil choke unto death? Try me and find out.~ [BD39817]
@39818 = ~Ah! Such sweet and savory arrogance. Thrix is tempted to simply take the Red Wizard and have done with it. But that would go against the spirit of the game. Who shall Thrix choose, then?~
@39819 = ~When it's time, Maglubiyet gets me, not you. But it's not time yet.~ [BD39819]
@39820 = ~Oh, she is a sharp one, Thrix likes her. But you have made your feelings clear, <CHARNAME>. Thrix shall abide by your decision.~
@39821 = ~Looks like I'll get to smile a little longer, demon.~ [BD39821]
@39822 = ~Does Thrix call you a dwarf, gnome? No? Then call Thrix a devil, for that is what he is. Now. Who shall Thrix take...?~
@39823 = ~Yes. Most amusing.~ [BD39823]
@39824 = ~Just as well, I suppose. The last thing Thrix needs is trouble with Ur-Gothoz. Who shall join Thrix the Profane if <CHARNAME> loses the wager?~
@39825 = ~Ugh. UGH. UUUUUUUUGH. Just keep your paws off of me.~
@39826 = ~Thrix thinks you would have found the flames of Avernus too familiar to truly enjoy anyway. But if not you, then who?~
@39827 = ~I am no one's prize, be they devil or man. Count yourself lucky I've not been made part of this—both of you.~ [BD39827]
@39828 = ~The drow is too tart, even for Thrix's taste. He's better off with another.~
@39829 = ~Ho ho! You are a lucky devil. Voghiln is an old hand at gambling—he would teach you a thing or two. Well, maybe not two. A thing and a half, say.~ [BD39829]
@39830 = ~Thrix would teach you something, you corpulent braggart! Ahhh, forget the skald, he's not worth it. But who, then?~
@39831 = ~What game is it you play now, <CHARNAME>? Whose soul will you wager, if not these?~
@39832 = ~I can speak for just one soul in good conscience, and that is my own.~
@39833 = ~No souls, fiend. The winner's prize shall be life, the loser's, utter destruction. And the determination will be made in combat!~
@39834 = ~Hah! You think Thrix the Profane would sully his claws with your blood? No, <CHARNAME>, we shall not fight this day. Not when Thrix's fellow fiends can fight for him. And by the time you're through with them, Thrix's master should be finished with the Shining Lady.~ [BD39834]
@39835 = ~And by the time you're through with them, Thrix's master should be finished with the Shining Lady.~
@39836 = ~An alliterator? Thrix thanks you, <CHARNAME>. You have saved the Profane One a good deal of irritation.~
@39837 = ~FIRST, Tiax will kill all those who dare look down upon him.~
@39838 = ~THEN he will have all who question slaughtering the tall put to the death.~
@39839 = ~The families of those who question him must also be taught a lesson. Their firstborns will be sacrificed to Cyric! ~
@39840 = ~Whoever's left will happily accept Tiax's rule! Or ELSE... ~
@39841 = ~Well met. What can Tiax do for you this fine <DAYNIGHTALL>?~
@39842 = ~Are you all right?~
@39843 = ~I would have you join me on a great adventure, Tiax. Cyric has promised glory to all who fight at my side.~
@39844 = ~There is naught you can do for me, or anyone, inside this dungeon.~
@39845 = ~Is Tiax all right? Tiax is more than all right! Tiax is mighty! All will bow before the wonder and glory of Tiax when Tiax rules!~
@39846 = ~Cyric said this to you? You dare go over Tiax's head? Tiax will grind your bones to paste, you gaping mackerel!~
@39847 = ~DIE! DIE IN TIAX'S NAME!~
@39848 = ~You are lucky Tiax chooses to await his destiny in this cell. But your luck will run out when he rules. Tremble in terror—the day is coming!~
@39849 = ~Now begone. Tiax would have a nap.~
@39850 = ~You see a dungeon? Are you mad? This is no dungeon, it is the beating heart of all Toril. And Tiax is in that heart, bathing in the blood of all who live!~
@39851 = ~HAHAHAHAHAHAHA!~
@39852 = ~Yes, friend? Can I be of service? ~ [BD39852]
@39853 = ~I fear not, unless you've changed your mind on joining me.~
@39854 = ~You COULD be, if you were to face Caelar at my side.~
@39855 = ~Perhaps. You've spent some time in the company of those who've fled Caelar's crusade. What have you learned of her?~
@39856 = ~To someone, I'm sure. But not to me.~
@39857 = ~I am sorry. I am needed here now. I cannot leave. ~ [BD39857]
@39858 = ~Ask me anything but that, and I will do what I can to help you. ~ [BD39858]
@39859 = ~I'm sorry you won't be joining me, but you must do what honor demands, of course.~
@39860 = ~Have the refugees told you anything of Caelar?~
@39861 = ~If you will not do that, you can do nothing for me.~
@39862 = ~Precious little, I'm afraid. What I've heard is secondhand at best.~ [BD39862]
@39863 = ~Her followers seem to fall into two broad categories—mercenaries of various races hired to do her bidding, and those she has recruited to her cause. There is some dispute over which is more fearful.~ [BD39863]
@39864 = ~Of the woman herself, most know of her through her followers' actions. Few have seen her personally. Those who do tend to side with her afterwards.~ [BD39864]
@39865 = ~She is, by all accounts, a powerful personality, with a charisma that overwhelms her enemies as much as any sword she wields. Families have been torn apart because of her, brother turned against brother. A dire situation.~ [BD39865]
@39866 = ~Thank you, Rasaad. You've been very helpful.~
@39867 = ~Dire indeed. And I'm right in the middle of it—again.~
@39868 = ~The situation is well in hand. Caelar's threat will be dealt with in short order.~
@39869 = ~I am glad you understand. Now if you will excuse me, I have matters I must attend to. May Selûne smile upon you. Farewell.~ [BD39869]
@39870 = ~Please excuse me, then. I have matters I must attend to.~ [BD39870]
@39871 = ~It is your destiny to do great things. You can embrace it or no, but fate will not be denied. Please excuse me now. There are matters I must attend to. May you find favor in Selûne's eyes.~ [BD39871]
@39872 = ~More wine? I'll not have any more myself, but you're decent enough company, for the most part.~ [BD39872]
@39873 = ~For the most part?~
@39874 = ~Tempting, but no. I've too much to do before we head out.~
@39875 = ~I've had more than enough for the night.~
@39876 = ~Take it as a compliment. ~ [BD39876]
@39877 = ~You are a woman of refinement and taste.~
@39878 = ~Is that how it was intended?~
@39879 = ~I don't think I will. I know a compliment when I hear one.~
@39880 = ~You noticed. Good eye. ~ [BD39880]
@39881 = ~I'm noticing a lot of things about you.~
@39882 = ~I've two eyes, actually, and they're better than good. I've been told they're spectacular.~
@39883 = ~You seem pretty observant yourself. Tell me what you make of me.~
@39884 = ~Don't look too hard. You might not like what you see.~ [BD39884]
@39885 = ~Let me know when you want to leave, <CHARNAME>. ~ [BD39885]
@39886 = ~Ask me no questions, I'll tell you no lies. I'll follow you out when you leave.~ [BD39886]
@39887 = ~As you wish. I'll follow you out when you leave.~ [BD39887]
@39888 = ~And how much had the person who told you that had to drink?~ [BD39888]
@39889 = ~Just joking. They're pretty good eyes, I'll give you that. Finish up what you need to do here and I'll follow you out when you leave.~ [BD39889]
@39890 = ~Take it however you want, then, but I should warn you, if you think that was insulting, our time together's going to be... uncomfortable.~ [BD39890]
@39891 = ~I think I'll keep that to myself—for the moment. I'll be by the door. I'll follow you out when you go.~ [BD39891]
@39892 = ~And that is that. Get some sleep. I'd do the same if I were able. If you need anything, I'll probably be around here organizing the caravan till the morning.~
@39893 = ~What's this?~
@39894 = ~This monk says he belongs to you, <CHARNAME>?~
@39895 = ~Rasaad? What are you doing here?~
@39896 = ~Rasaad! Tell me you've changed your mind and come to join me.~
@39897 = ~What do you want, monk?~
@39898 = ~It is good to see a friendly face in the wilderness. I come to join you on your quest, <CHARNAME>—if you will still have me.~ [BD39898]
@39899 = ~I would welcome the assistance, Rasaad. You know that. But why the change of heart?~
@39900 = ~What brings you this way? You seemed determined to remain in Baldur's Gate.~
@39901 = ~You had your chance, monk. Begone.~
@39902 = ~I—took some time to reflect on what really matters in this world. Helping the needy is a worthy ambition, but Baldur's Gate is not where I should be right now.~ [BD39902]
@39903 = ~I smell a story there. What's going on, Rasaad?~
@39904 = ~I don't need your help at the moment, but I might later. Wait in camp for me and I'll call on you when I need you.~
@39905 = ~And where should you be, then?~
@39906 = ~Would that I could tell you, my friend. I am grasping at shadows, perhaps real, perhaps imagined. I will not drag you into my darkness, not until I know the truth. When my path is clear, you will be the first to know. Until then...~ [BD39906]
@39907 = ~Come, join me. ~
@39908 = ~I—took some time to reflect on what was really important. My sect is doing valuable work in Baldur's Gate, but it is not where I should be right now. ~ [BD39908]
@39909 = ~I would join you—if you'll have me. ~ [BD39909]
@39910 = ~Yes, I require your aid. Join me.~
@39911 = ~I don't need help at the moment, but things change. Wait for me in the Flaming Fist camp east of here.~
@39912 = ~You made your choice back in the Gate, monk. Begone.~
@39913 = ~When I am ready. Aye.~
@39914 = ~If that is your wish, my friend. May Selûne smile upon you.~ [BD39914]
@39915 = ~Thank you, <CHARNAME>. I have always treasured your support, and your wisdom. I fear I may need both before long.~ [BD39915]
@39916 = ~If it is wisdom you need, Boo is there for you. He is a gifted counselor of the bold and the bald.~ [BD39916]
@39917 = ~Come one, come all! Come catch a glimpse of the cream of the Sword Coast's combatant crop! Witness the brilliant and the bizarre battle in the Black Pits of the one and only Baeloth the Entertainer!~
@39918 = ~Gather in the gallery, my gallants! 'Tis time for another test 'twixt two titanic terrors in Baeloth's blackest pit yet!~
@39919 = ~Yayyyy...~
@39920 = ~Fate favors you fortunate few who will witness these feral foes in a furious fray! First, I give you the wild wonder of the western kingdoms. Wise men say only fools rush in to face... the wolverine!~
@39921 = ~That's a wolverine? Looks like a rat...~
@39922 = ~But what could win in war against the wild wolverine? There's but one answer: that hardy, hate-filled horror, the honey badger!~
@39923 = ~Now that is DEFINITELY a squirrel.~
@39924 = ~I bid the battle... BEGIN!~
@39925 = ~Booo...~
@39926 = ~You call this entertainment? Coz I don't.~
@39927 = ~Me mum and dad've 'ad better fights than this over Midwinter dinner!~
@39928 = ~Where's the blood? Where's the furious beauty of the battle? Where's the eternal dance of life and death, the dramatic clash of tooth an' claw in an unendin' battle for survival and supremacy, played out before us in the theater of battle?~
@39929 = ~Yeah! Where is that stuff?~
@39930 = ~Patience, my peculiarly profound patrons! The primitive play you propose will be presented! ~ [BD39930]
@39931 = ~Gods, Baeloth! What are you up to now?~
@39932 = ~This display is as disgusting as it is disturbing. And it's over now.~
@39933 = ~Your audience is right, drow. This is about as entertaining as watching grass grow.~
@39934 = ~Present it soon or I'll give these people the show they desire.~
@39935 = ~You crave more, you cretinous creatures—er, cultured company of canniness and class? I concur. And so I give you... the goblin!~ [BD39935]
@39936 = ~And so I give you... the goblin!~
@39937 = ~I prithee patience, <PRO_SIRMAAM>. I promise a powerful performance of unparalleled passion! And so I give you... the goblin!~
@39938 = ~Your words wound worse than any weapon. If you've no appreciation for what I provide, I'll not waste time worrying about your wailing.~
@39939 = ~I'm with <PRO_HIMHER>—come on, everyone. Let's go do something more fun. Like sleeping or repeatedly bashing our heads against a tree.~
@39940 = ~Do I know you?~ [BD39940]
@39941 = ~You don't remember? It wasn't so long ago we fought together, each at the other's side.~
@39942 = ~We've not met. I'd remember you.~
@39943 = ~You should. I'm pretty sure I killed you once.~
@39944 = ~Ah, yes. <CHARNAME>. It's... moderately mortifying to see you again. But the past is past, and these people pine for a performance. And so I give you... the goblin!~ [BD39944]
@39945 = ~You flatter me.~ [BD39945]
@39946 = ~I'm gonna FLATTEN you if this show doesn't improve.~
@39947 = ~Let me out of here, drow! Let me out!~ [BD39947]

@39955 = ~The goblin clearly doesn't want to be here. Release her. Now.~
@39956 = ~A goblin against a drow—there's a fight worth watching. Do it, goblin! Fight! Fight!~
@39957 = ~Think on this a tick, noble one. Have you ever met a goblin that DIDN'T thirst for the thrill of the fray?~ [BD39957]
@39958 = ~Free me, snake!~ [BD39958]
@39959 = ~Shut your slobbering facehole, you sniveling smutch!~
@39960 = ~She says she doesn't want to fight.~
@39961 = ~Be silent, drow. I would speak with this goblin.~

@39963 = ~What she wants—? Worthless! ~
@39964 = ~Not to me.~
@39965 = ~How much do you want for her?~
@39966 = ~I'll be the judge of that. ~
@39967 = ~It's over, drow. Free these wretches, or you'll answer to the Flaming Fist.~
@39968 = ~Or me!~
@39969 = ~What?~
@39970 = ~I'd not see this goblin suffer, and I doubt you'll let her go without payment. So tell me, what price her freedom?~
@39971 = ~I'm trying to get you out of here.~
@39972 = ~Be silent, goblin. We'll speak soon enough.~
@39973 = ~Being stuck in this hole is disgrace enough. I'll NOT be bought and sold.~
@39974 = ~Still your tongue, you sniveling scapegrace. I'm trying to think here.~
@39975 = ~Think on this, drow!~
@39976 = ~Recognize your role, you repellent wretch. I am the Entertainer. I speak. You watch and applaud—or remove yourself, if you'd rather.~ [BD39976]

@39990 = ~You're right, <PRO_RACE>. 'Twas a shoddy sham of a show, so short of Baeloth the Entertainer's solid gold standards I'm shamed to say it. ~
