@52706 = ~Boo! Booooo!~
@52707 = ~Locket of Embracing~
@52708 = ~Good <DAYNIGHTALL> to you, <PRO_SIRMAAM>. How can I be of assistance?~
@52709 = ~I'd like a drink.~
@52710 = ~Tell me about yourself.~
@52711 = ~What can you tell me about this place?~
@52712 = ~You're in luck! We have drinks here. ~
@52713 = ~Who, me? There's not much to tell. The tavern needed someone to run the taps and I needed a few extra coins in my pocket.~
@52714 = ~Who, me? There's not much to tell. The tavern needed someone to run the taps, and I needed some coin in my pocket. My man's a sailor, so he's gone for weeks at a time. This keeps me busy and lets me talk to people.~
@52715 = ~I'd like a drink now.~
@52716 = ~You must get lonely from time to time.~
@52717 = ~What can you tell me about this inn?~
@52718 = ~I have to be going now.~
@52719 = ~The Three Old Kegs is one of the oldest taverns in Baldur's Gate. Never thought I'd be working somewhere so fancy! Nantrin Bellowglym runs the place. ~
@52720 = ~Interesting. I'd like a drink now, please.~
@52721 = ~Tell me about yourself.~
@52722 = ~I have to be going now.~
@52723 = ~I don't want to hear that kind of talk, <PRO_SIRMAAM>. My man's at sea as often as not, but I'm happy with him all the same. Now do you want a drink or not?~
@52724 = ~Go on, you! I'm happy with my man, flatter me though you will. Now can I get your charming self a drink?~
@52725 = ~A good <DAYNIGHTALL> to you.~
@52726 = ~As you wish.~
@52727 = ~Who am I here to find, again?~
@52728 = ~You're not much of a bodyguard, are you?~
@52729 = ~Call if you need me.~
@52730 = ~I was told to get you where you wanted to go and I have. What you do now is your own business. If you need me, you know where to find me.~
@52731 = ~A bard named Garrick. Though why a bard would spend time here is beyond me. House rules discourage singing—at least by those of Garrick's ilk.~
@52732 = ~There's also Safana and Coran, a pair of unsavory characters staying upstairs Belt thinks might be of use. Why he'd think that, I don't know, but it's not my place to argue with a Grand Duke.~
@52733 = ~Done?~
@52734 = ~Let's go.~
@52735 = ~Garrick. A pretty boy with an empty head, I've heard. Which would explain what he's doing in a place where he won't be allowed to perform.~
@52736 = ~Aye, a pair of cutpurses named Safana and Coran.~
@52737 = ~Well, when you are ready to go, just head out. I'll follow you.~
@52738 = ~If I'm understanding you correctly—and I think I am—what you're trying to say here is that you're done? Yes? Then let's go.~
@52739 = ~Who am I looking for here again? A bard, was it?~
@52740 = ~Who exactly am I supposed to find here? A couple of thieves, is that right?~
@52741 = ~It's not been so long since we ventured together, has it, Garrick?~
@52742 = ~It's possible—I am <CHARNAME>, hero of Baldur's Gate. But I don't recognize you.~
@52743 = ~Recognize me if you must, but do not speak to me.~
@52744 = ~Well allow me to change that! I am Garrick. A performer of no little renown, though the house rules regrettably prevent me from properly exhibiting my talents. Please join me.~
@52745 = ~You're in a tavern, friend. People speak to each other in taverns. But I can tell you prefer they not speak to you, and I shall honor your wish. Farewell.~
@52746 = ~The same two feet that will carry me away from this pointless conversation.~
@52747 = ~If you wish to insult me, you'll have to do better than that. I've developed rather a thick skin of late. Fare thee well.~
@52748 = ~Which isn't to suggest it's actually good...~ [BD52748]
@52749 = ~Do you know any songs about hamsters? I'm asking for a friend.~ [BD52749]
@52750 = ~Is it true an elven maid's ghost sometimes fills this place with song?~ [BD52750]
@52751 = ~It is true, more's the pity. It's her song and her song alone that patrons here are allowed to enjoy.~
@52752 = ~Then why art thou here at all?~ [BD52752]
@52753 = ~The answer to that is simple enough...~
@52754 = ~Gods, will this story ever end? Here, let me help you get to the point: The only person allowed to sing in the Elfsong tavern is the ghost of the elf for which it's named. Which makes it a place sensible bards tend to avoid.~ [BD52754]
@52755 = ~Do you really need to ask?~ [BD52755]
@52756 = ~It can actually be rather enjoyable—depending on who's doing the unrequiting.~ [BD52756]
@52757 = ~Thou hast a lump of coal where thy heart should be. I'm sure of it.~ [BD52757]
@52758 = ~Coming around is one of my favorite things! It was after a glorious battle that I came around and discovered Boo, nibbling on my provisions as he anxiously waited for me to awake. That was a good day.~ [BD52758]
@52759 = ~Ale for me. And a bowl of water for my hamster.~ [BD52759]
@52760 = ~Is that some sort of euphem— No, I see you've actually got a hamster. I'll fetch your drinks.~
@52761 = ~There is nothing there to admire. Women—real women, not the farcical creatures who exist in your fanciful tales of "romance"—like nothing better than being taken at their word. A courteous man bows and walks away from a woman who's not interested.~ [BD52761]
@52762 = ~With respect, milady, I am well aware what women like. Artists often face rejection. It takes more than a simple "no" to discourage us.~
@52763 = ~Come, <CHARNAME>, let us take our leave of this lovestruck dullard. Or better still, let's bide a time and see him struck by something less abstract in nature. Like a frying pan.~ [BD52763]
@52764 = ~Dost thou believe her a god's spawn? Could she be a child of Bhaal?~ [BD52764]
@52765 = ~Do you know what I like about you, <CHARNAME>? There must be SOMEthing—I'd not wander the Flaming Fist's headquarters for most people.~ [BD52765]
@52766 = ~Oh. You've brought me to a jail. You have the soul of a romantic, <CHARNAME>.~ [BD52766]
@52767 = ~Talk to the madman yet?~
@52768 = ~That's one way to put it.~
@52769 = ~Less "talked" than "got bellowed at by."~
@52770 = ~Yes. But I'd like to poke around here a bit more, if that's all right.~
@52771 = ~I believe we're done here.~
@52772 = ~No, not yet.~
@52773 = ~I won't ask. Don't need to—I could hear most of it from here. Shall we go?~
@52774 = ~Let's. The sooner I put this place behind me, the better.~
@52775 = ~I'd like to look around here a bit more, if that's all right.~
@52776 = ~Not quite yet.~
@52777 = ~You're an odd duck, <CHARNAME>. But suit yourself. I'll follow you out once you're done here.~
@52778 = ~It's no Ducal Palace, is it? Let's go.~
@52779 = ~Let's go.~
@52780 = ~Well, do what you're going to do. We've more useful places than this to be.~
@52781 = ~Yeah, I heard most of it. You ready to go?~
@52782 = ~I'm finished here.~
@52783 = ~I'm going to poke around here a bit more first.~
@52784 = ~Not quite yet.~
@52785 = ~Are you sure, little loud man? It LOOKS like a cell...~ [BD52785]
@52786 = ~Thou art realizing this only now...?~ [BD52786]
@52787 = ~Well, that was time well spent.~ [BD52787]
@52788 = ~In wonder I can believe, but glory? Thou think'st too highly of thyself, gnome.~ [BD52788]
@52789 = ~Aw, he wants to go beddy bye. That's adorable.~ [BD52789]
@52790 = ~A noble gesture. ~
@52791 = ~What am I looking for here?~
@52792 = ~A waste of resources better spent preparing for battle with Caelar. ~
@52793 = ~The Grand Dukes thought so. The day-to-day operations are handled by priests and monks of different faiths.~
@52794 = ~I'll be here if you need me. Try not to get into any trouble. ~
@52795 = ~A Selûnite monk named Rasaad yn Bashir. He's helping care for the refugees.~
@52796 = ~The streets are crowded enough. If refugees staying here makes it easier for the Fist out there... well, this building has been put to worse uses.~
@52797 = ~Done what you came to do? ~
@52798 = ~The monk has other things on his mind right now. He won't be joining us.~
@52799 = ~For all the good it did. ~
@52800 = ~Yes, but bide a time. I wish to see more of this place. ~
@52801 = ~Bide a time. I would see more of this place. ~
@52802 = ~No, not yet. ~
@52803 = ~I'm finished here. ~
@52804 = ~Sometimes things go your way, sometimes they don't. Such is life. ~
@52805 = ~Must be a lot of memories here for you. Take your time. If you need me, you know where to find me. ~
@52806 = ~Let's go. ~
@52807 = ~Take your time. It's not like I've a military expedition to coordinate or anything.~
@52808 = ~You know me, monk? ~
@52809 = ~I'd say we can be reasonably sure there's something wrong with at least one of you, regardless of what the monk sees.~ [BD52809]
@52810 = ~There are few in this city who don't know the hero of Baldur's Gate. But what brings you back to this place?~ [BD52810]
@52811 = ~An impending journey to the north. I need people of skill and honor, people I can trust, by my side. I need you.~
@52812 = ~Come morning, I shall embark on a journey north to face Caelar Argent. I would have you beside me. ~
@52813 = ~Would that I could join you. I would see Caelar fall as much as any man who's heard the tales these people tell. But another, more subtle darkness is spreading as well. In the past few weeks, many servants of Selûne have gone missing. ~ [BD52813]
@52814 = ~These are turbulent times. Perhaps your fellows are simply engaged in their own business, and neglected to inform thee of their plans. Art thou certain foul play has occurred?~ [BD52814]
@52815 = ~I cannot deny the possibility. But it is a risk I cannot afford to take. ~ [BD52815]
@52816 = ~Even if I could leave the refugees to their fates, I cannot abandon my brothers and sisters, not now. I am truly sorry. ~ [BD52816]
@52817 = ~Don't be, Rasaad. Your fellow Selûnites need you. The Fist will be with me. I'll manage. ~
@52818 = ~As am I. Fare thee well, Rasaad yn Bashir. I hope we meet again. ~
@52819 = ~Fine. Waste your time caring for sheep while a stronger <PRO_MANWOMAN> goes to face down the wolf. I don't need you.~
@52820 = ~Do they truly need to say it? It's unlikely they would be standing here now had the assassins finished the job.~ [BD52820]
@52821 = ~Art thou certain foul play has occurred? These are turbulent times. Perhaps thy colleagues are engaged in their own business, and simply neglected to tell thee.~ [BD52821]
@52822 = ~I cannot deny the possibility. But it is a risk I cannot afford to take. ~ [BD52822]
@52823 = ~I love what you've done with your hair. If only Minsc could make his do the same, but alas, it is not to be. Farewell. ~
@52824 = ~The monk has made his intentions clear. This pathetic attempt to elicit guilt for his decision is beneath thee.~ [BD52824]
@52825 = ~Boo says it is better to have a second hand than no hands at all. This is the wisdom of the space hamster. ~ [BD52825]
@52826 = ~Perhaps thou should let the monk speak, Minsc. Rasaad, thou wert telling us of the Shining Lady...?~ [BD52826]
@52827 = ~Please. I admire optimism as much as the next girl, <CHARNAME>, but there is a limit.~ [BD52827]
@52828 = ~It is a good thing. As long as hope remains in our hearts, darkness cannot prevail. I pray you have good fortune on your journey. Now if you will excuse me, I have matters I must attend to. Farewell.~ [BD52828]
@52829 = ~I can't imagine why. One look at her tells me all I care to know. ~ [BD52829]
@52830 = ~It's always good to see a woman in a position of power. Tell us about yourself. ~ [BD52830]
@52831 = ~Yes! And Minsc and Boo will join you. ~ [BD52831]
@52832 = ~I do not think Boo would enjoy not sleeping in the fashion <CHARNAME> anticipates.~ [BD52832]
@52833 = ~My mind is filled with images of butts... Evil butts, and the kicking we shall give them! ~ [BD52833]
@52834 = ~And what we can stop her from doing. ~ [BD52834]
@52835 = ~Our cause is just. What could be better than fighting for it, eh? Boo, can you tell me this? No, I thought not. ~
@52836 = ~Not everyone finds combat as thrilling as thee, Minsc. We have talked about this, remember? ~
@52837 = ~Not really? Are you sure we talked about it? I really don't think we did... Boo, do you remember? ~
@52838 = ~The assassins are dead. <CHARNAME> lives. I'd say our friend here was on as right a side as it's possible to be in such circumstances. ~
@52839 = ~You needn't worry about that. <CHARNAME> is completely oblivious. He doesn't notice the most obvious things, even those things right in front of his face.~ [BD52839]
@52840 = ~Well done, <CHARNAME>. Put the mercenary in her place. ~
@52841 = ~Maybe you could put me in my place, Safana.~
@52842 = ~Are you suggesting we, that you and I, we—what are you suggesting, exactly? ~
@52843 = ~You tell me. Give it some thought and let me know what you come up with. <CHARNAME>, I'll follow you out once you leave.~
@52844 = ~Now that I'm looking at him, I'm not so sure that's true. This elf has the air of a scoundrel about him. ~ [BD52844]
@52845 = ~Boo does not like scoundrels. I do not like scoundrels either. ~ [BD52845]
@52846 = ~I'd like nothing better than to help you, <CHARNAME>—well actually, that's a lie. There are many things I'd rather do—I believe I'll go do some of them right now. No, no, don't start, my mind is made up. I'll not be swayed by tears. Hey—it's all right. I'm sure you'll do fine without me. ~
@52847 = ~It is rare for this one to have a bad day, I think.~ [BD52847]
@52848 = ~In broadest strokes, please. I, for one, have little interest in the details. ~ [BD52848]
@52849 = ~Boo says the more details, the better. My hamster thirsts for knowledge. ~ [BD52849]
@52850 = ~And of course your first thought was of Safana. You have impeccable taste, <CHARNAME>. And as it happens I'm not enjoying the city as much recently. A journey with the hero of the city might be just the thing to shake me from my doldrums. ~
@52851 = ~Consider me persuaded. I will join you. Let's be away from this miserable place before SOMEone returns to make it even more miserable...~ [BD52851]
@52852 = ~No. You aren't. ~
@52853 = ~I think she wishes us to leave. Does anyone else have that feeling?~ [BD52853]
@52854 = ~You'll feel a chair smashed against your skull if you don't leave this instant, you demented oaf. Go!~ [BD52854]
@52855 = ~Minsc is an old hand at being begone. Do as I do, everyone. Be quiet and walk slowly... away... ~ [BD52855]
@52856 = ~It is hard to avoid, sometimes. ~ [BD52856]
@52857 = ~The more the merrier! ~ [BD52857]
@52858 = ~Do not fear, <CHARNAME>. Her heart is not really breaking, Boo says. Her face is pretty, but her mouth is full of lies. ~ [BD52858]
@52859 = ~We will see who punish murders who for murder punishment—right now!~ [BD52859]
@52860 = ~Do you think there might be a better strategy we could use here than goading a half-mad mage to anger?~ [BD52860]
@52861 = ~Thou wilt see the wicked one long before us, mage. ~
@52862 = ~How did she get free? ~ [BD52862]
@52863 = ~I would have. My time with Boo has made me a keen observer of my surroundings. ~ [BD52863]
@52864 = ~Show some compassion, <CHARNAME>. Just seconds ago these guards fought for their life. Their blood runs hot in their veins. Only a fool would expect poetry under such circumstances.~ [BD52864]
@52865 = ~All the boys are leaving? That is a shame. Ah well, life goes on.~ [BD52865]
@52866 = ~Not yet, I'm afraid. I'll keep searching.~
@52867 = ~Another Fist was here a few moments ago. They didn't mention one of their own being in a cell.~
@52868 = ~I was told the only occupied cell down here held a doppelganger.~
@52869 = ~They didn't know I was here. You need to get me out of here, quickly—though I may be safer in here than you are out there.~
@52870 = ~You seem very anxious to leave the security of your cell...~
@52871 = ~Just let me out! Please! ~
@52872 = ~I see. Very well, then, let us speak honestly. I have much to offer you, if you give me my freedom.~
@52873 = ~And what does this word "veritable" mean? ~ [BD52873]
@52874 = ~Do not cross me, doppelganger. I've better things to do than hunt an errant shapeshifter through the city. Make me do so and you will pay a heavy price.~
@52875 = ~I'll be there. See that you are too. ~
@52876 = ~Better than you have tried to escape my wrath—all lie dead. Understood?~
@52877 = ~Who art thou, and how wert thou ensnared? ~ [BD52877]
@52878 = ~Let Minsc handle this, <CHARNAME>. I am good at this game. Tell me, mercenary: Is it animal, vegetable, or mineral? ~ [BD52878]
@52879 = ~I—I don't know what you mean... ~
@52880 = ~Thanks doesn't pay the rent, as my grandmother used to say. ~ [BD52880]
@52881 = ~I've heard THAT story before. ~ [BD52881]
@52882 = ~Barrels line the walls, filled with enough water to sustain Caelar's crusade in Dragonspear Castle for months.~
@52883 = ~Barrels line the walls, filled with enough water to sustain Caelar's crusade in Dragonspear Castle for months. If you wished, you could poison them.~
@52884 = ~You pour a drop of poison into each water barrel. The water takes on a musty smell.~
@52885 = ~Sacks of wheat, potatoes, and onions are piled high. With this much food, the gods alone know how long Caelar's crusade could hold Dragonspear.~
@52886 = ~Sacks of wheat, potatoes, and onions are piled high. With this much food, the gods alone know how long the crusade might hold the castle. That could change if you use the poison Torsin de Lancie supplied you.~
@52887 = ~You apply the poison to the supplies. A foul smell curdles the air, but it dissipates quickly. Someone in Dragonspear will regret eating this food, and soon.~
@52888 = ~Refugee~
@52889 = ~I lost everything... everything.~
@52890 = ~The inn burned down a few days ago, and now we don't even have shelter on the road.~
@52891 = ~The crusade took me food an' left me in the dust. I head south and what do I find? More destruction.~
@52892 = ~I haven't been able to find my sister since the crusade came through. She'll be all right, won't she?~
@52893 = ~Fifty years that farm's been in my family. All gone now, thanks to that Shining Witch.~
@52894 = ~I wish the inn were still standing, but crusaders burned it down. Not a very noble act.~
@52895 = ~I prayed to Helm for protection, but the crusade still burned my home. Can it be true Caelar has the gods' favor?~
@52896 = ~I was thinking of moving anyway.~
@52897 = ~Caelar's mercenaries could have at least left the inn standing so we'd have somewhere to sleep.~
@52898 = ~I'm nearly out of food. Got some hungry days ahead, I think.~
@52899 = ~What's the crusade hoping to accomplish? They've seized the bridge, and now we can't even head north.~
@52900 = ~I've seen you before. I was in Baldur's Gate not long ago—you're the one who killed Sarevok. You can help us!~
@52901 = ~You've better things to do than talk to me, I'm sure.~
@52902 = ~Well met, my <PRO_LADYLORD>.~
@52903 = ~The crusade is massed by the bridge. No one's getting over the Winding Water now.~
@52904 = ~That makes two of us.~ [BD52904]
@52905 = ~Naught but the false promises of a lying devil. We shall not be deceived.~ [BD52905]
@52906 = ~Mercy? I'll show more than you would have. Did you like your cell? You'll be enjoying its comforts for a long time to come.~
@52907 = ~The doppelthinger calls us crazy, Boo. This insult cannot stand!~ [BD52907]
@52908 = ~Oh, <CHARNAME>. You don't actually believe this doppelganger, do you?~ [BD52908]
@52909 = ~The treasure is very real, I assure you.~
@52910 = ~Thou are wise to ignore this creature's words, <CHARNAME>. It would say anything to trick thee into freeing it.~ [BD52910]
@52911 = ~Heed this Rashemen cow's words and you'll be throwing away a fortune. The choice is yours.~
@52912 = ~I'll be happy to do so, once you release me.~
@52913 = ~I am not sure this is such a good idea, <CHARNAME>...~ [BD52913]
@52914 = ~A valid philosophy, IF one can afford to lose what one ventures. 'Tis a bit late to consider that now, though. In future, you might consider consulting me sooner, that you might properly benefit from my wisdom.~ [BD52914]
@52915 = ~It must. Why else would it be here?~ [BD52915]
@52916 = ~Shame on you, <CHARNAME>. How could you doubt the intentions of a murderous shapeshifting monster?~ [BD52916]
@52917 = ~You understand, doppelthingy? No path crossing for you!~ [BD52917]
@52918 = ~You'll want to visit Sorcerous Sundries, then. I can get you there.~
@52919 = ~We can discuss that later. Right now, I need supplies.~
@52920 = ~Uh-oh.~
@52921 = ~All right, all right, I get the message!~
@52922 = ~So, <CHARNAME>... Long time no see. Well, I guess it hasn't been that long—like a few seconds, really—but... how are you? ~ [BD52922]
@52923 = ~I'm doing... well. All things considered.~
@52924 = ~Beyond having a madwoman and her army of zealots out to kill me? I'm fine. How are you?~
@52925 = ~Why do you ask?~
@52926 = ~I'd be better if I didn't get involved in a prolonged discussion about how I am.~
@52927 = ~Yeah, all right, you don't want to talk. I get it. Just know this, then. Whatever you have to face, you don't have to face it alone. If you need to talk—I'm here.~ [BD52927]
@52928 = ~You just seem—different.~ [BD52928]
@52929 = ~If I am, it's only in response to an unpleasant situation. I'm still the same <PRO_MANWOMAN> I've always been.~
@52930 = ~Having a crazed paladin target you for death does tend to change one's outlook.~
@52931 = ~Circumstances change. I do not. Whatever you see in me now is a product of your own overactive imagination.~
@52932 = ~Caelar's who you should be focused upon. Or possibly Adoy. What I am, if I have indeed changed—it matters not.~
@52933 = ~I don't think so. There's something about you, a—I don't want to say darkness, but I just did, so I guess it's too late now. ~ [BD52933]
@52934 = ~I'm a child of Bhaal. Darkness is in my blood.~
@52935 = ~If you've a problem with me, Neera, you're free to go.~
@52936 = ~Dark times inspire dark thoughts.~
@52937 = ~If I seem darker now than when last we met, it's only because you're now seeing me with open eyes.~
@52938 = ~Just don't drown in those thoughts, all right?~ [BD52938]
@52939 = ~You really don't get it, do you? Friends HELP friends with their problems.~ [BD52939]
@52940 = ~I'm not sure I like the new you. Or the old you. Whatever you is talking to me now. I'm—I'm gonna stop talking to both of you for the moment.~ [BD52940]
@52941 = ~You don't really care to know the answer, do you?~ [BD52941]
@52942 = ~Forgive me, Neera. I didn't mean to be harsh. It's just been a trying time.~
@52943 = ~No, please, tell me. Every fiber of my being is consumed by a desire to talk about your feelings.~
@52944 = ~Not particularly.~
@52945 = ~How we feel... It's irrelevant. It doesn't matter. All that matters is what we do.~
@52946 = ~I'm tempted to tell you all about them in excruciating detail just because I know it'd bother you.~ [BD52946]
@52947 = ~You've changed, <CHARNAME>. You're—darker now. Or maybe you've always been that way and I'm only just seeing it.~ [BD52947]
@52948 = ~For a lot of people. But you seem to get the sharp edge of the sword more often than most.~ [BD52948]
@52949 = ~That's just part and parcel of being a child of Bhaal.~
@52950 = ~If I didn't have bad luck, I'd have no luck at all.~
@52951 = ~I give worse than I get.~
@52952 = ~You aren't your father, <CHARNAME>. You're nothing like him. Look at all the good you've done. ~ [BD52952]
@52953 = ~I try to. I do. But it's hard to see it sometimes.~
@52954 = ~You always did know how to cheer me up.~
@52955 = ~Look at all the blood I've spilled doing it.~
@52956 = ~You tread on dangerous ground, Neera. You may not like where you find yourself.~
@52957 = ~You did what you had to do. You always have. You carry whatever weight the world puts on you, always. I wish I could say the same.~ [BD52957]
@52958 = ~Speaking of weight, this conversation's a little too heavy for me. But—if you do need to talk—I'm here. All right?~ [BD52958]
@52959 = ~Thanks, Neera.~
@52960 = ~I'll keep it in mind.~
@52961 = ~Any time.~ [BD52961]
@52962 = ~Or perhaps, "Thank you, Neera," and then "You're welcome, <CHARNAME>."~ [BD52962]
@52963 = ~Just joking. Mostly. If you need me, you know where to find me.~ [BD52963]
@52964 = ~All things? That's a lot of things to consider. Could we just consider MOST things? Or the good things?~ [BD52964]
@52965 = ~I guess it would. Luckily, I only do have to guess. I don't know how I'd feel walking a mile in your boots. I'd probably spend it running the exact opposite direction you are.~ [BD52965]
@52966 = ~I do seem to attract trouble. My father's gift to his beloved <PRO_SONDAUGHTER>.~
@52967 = ~Yes, well, you're a sensible person. Unfortunately, I'm me.~
@52968 = ~Whatever you have to face, you don't have to face it alone. If you need to talk—I'm here. All right? ~ [BD52968]
@52969 = ~Thanks, Neera.~
@52970 = ~I'll keep it in mind.~
@52971 = ~I think you may be the first person who has ever accused me of being sensible...~ [BD52971]
@52972 = ~Yeah, but you always manage to deal with it. No matter what the world throws at you, you keep going. I don't know how you do it. But there's something you should know...~
@52973 = ~That's what I'm here for! But seriously, <CHARNAME>...~ [BD52973]
@52974 = ~Shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up... ~ [BD52974]
@52975 = ~I'm starting to worry about you, Neera. We've got to get that wild mage out of your head.~
@52976 = ~Adoy's still giving you trouble, I take it?~
@52977 = ~I'm going to not talk to you now, which from the sounds of it should suit both of us.~
@52978 = ~I swear he's driving me insane, <CHARNAME>. ~ [BD52978]
@52979 = ~You're strong, Neera. You can handle this. We'll get the ingredients for your potion together soon, and then you'll be free of Adoy.~
@52980 = ~At least it's a short trip.~
@52981 = ~How can you tell?~
@52982 = ~KEEP TALKING! I'LL FIND YOU, AND WHEN I DO, YOU ARE GOING TO REGRET THE DAY YOU WERE BORN! ~ [BD52982]
@52983 = ~Try to remember Adoy's as much a victim in this as you are. I'm sure he's no more thrilled being stuck in your head than you are having him stuck there.~
@52984 = ~Yeah, I did sort of go over the line there, didn't I?~
@52985 = ~I hope that was aimed at Adoy.~
@52986 = ~Screaming threats at the voice in your head. Of course. That will surely get the desired result.~
@52987 = ~It was. I already know where to find you. But make another "short trip" crack and Adoy will get a preview of what's coming to him...~ [BD52987]
@52988 = ~Gee, you think?~ [BD52988]
@52989 = ~Sorry. You know it's not you...~ [BD52989]
@52990 = ~I'd hope my voice in your head wouldn't affect you so.~
@52991 = ~I know. It's not easy for any of us right now, is it?~
@52992 = ~Even so, we're done talking now.~
@52993 = ~No, when I hear your voice, it makes me feel better. ~ [BD52993]
@52994 = ~I'm glad to hear it. I feel the same way.~
@52995 = ~Please tell me you don't hear my voice in your head like you do Adoy's.~
@52996 = ~And so it should.~
@52997 = ~And then your wonderful voice says something like that and my murderous impulses return. ~ [BD52997]
@52998 = ~Sorry. I shouldn't be making jokes about your situation.~
@52999 = ~Shutting up now.~
@53000 = ~Make good use of them. Focus on Caelar and her destruction.~
@53001 = ~I don't want that, necessarily. I just want you to tell me—tell me things are gonna be all right.~ [BD53001]
@53002 = ~They're going to be better than all right, Neera. For you, at least.~
@53003 = ~Things are going to be all right...?~
@53004 = ~You would have me lie to you.~
@53005 = ~I like the sound of that. I really hope you're right.~ [BD53005]
@53006 = ~I WOULD have, but you made mincemeat of that idea. Do you ever think before you open your mouth?~ [BD53006]
@53007 = ~No, don't answer that. I've had enough of your voice right now.~ [BD53007]
@53008 = ~And I've had enough of YOUR voice to last me a lifetime, Adoy. SEVERAL lifetimes. Long ones too, ones with great-grandkids. That's how much I've had it with your voice.~ [BD53008]
@53009 = ~Damn, <CHARNAME>, you could at least try a LITTLE. Way to kill the moment.~ [BD53009]
@53010 = ~Don't say any more. I've had enough of your voice for the moment.~ [BD53010]
@53011 = ~It's all right. When this is all over, I'm sure I'll look back on this all and laugh. Eventually.~ [BD53011]
@53012 = ~Kinda hard to focus at all right now. I've got to find the rest of this potion's ingredients. And soon.~ [BD53012]
@53013 = ~Really? My voice makes you feel good?~ [BD53013]
@53014 = ~It does. Things are—not great right now, obviously. But having you here makes it tolerable.~
@53015 = ~No. Mine does.~
@53016 = ~Yes. Because I know it will stop nattering, eventually, and I will finally have some peace.~
@53017 = ~Making things tolerable is what I do. Now if I could just get rid of Adoy, my life might get tolerable again...~ [BD53017]
@53018 = ~Ah, who am I kidding? My life's always been a mess. But it was a quiet mess; the only voices in my head were the ones that would SHUT UP, SHUT UP, SHUT UP when I told them to.~ [BD53018]
@53019 = ~I miss those voices. Especially the part where they STOPPED TALKING.~ [BD53019]
@53020 = ~TAKE THE HINT, ADOY. Yeesh...~ [BD53020]
@53021 = ~I remember when the voices in my head SHUT UP! SHUT UP! SHUT! UUUUUUUP! when I told them to.~ [BD53021]
@53022 = ~I know, I know. It's just—it feels like he never stops talking!~ [BD53022]
@53023 = ~And YOU can shut up too.~ [BD53023]
@53024 = ~Don't be that way, <CHARNAME>. I'm just—it's not easy for me, you know?~ [BD53024]
@53025 = ~It really isn't.~ [BD53025]
@53026 = ~Yes, that should work—worth a try, anyway...~ [BD53026]
@53027 = ~Hey, I need help.~ [BD53027]
@53028 = ~Is everything all right?~
@53029 = ~Really? I hadn't noticed... Joking! Don't give me that look.~
@53030 = ~Obviously. Good luck finding some.~
@53031 = ~Fine. I'm just—I AM TRYING TO HAVE A MOMENT. SHUT UP.~ [BD53031]
@53032 = ~What look? I don't know what you're—I SWEAR TO GODS, I AM TRYING TO HAVE A MOMENT, SHUT UP—talking about!~ [BD53032]
@53033 = ~Wait, wait, wait, wait! Wait. Don't leave me. Please?~ [BD53033]
@53034 = ~Look. I'll be honest.~ [BD53034]
@53035 = ~I need a distraction. Something. Anything. Desperately.~ [BD53035]
@53036 = ~How desperately are we talking?~
@53037 = ~Ever try sport?~
@53038 = ~Have you tried talking to Minsc?~
@53039 = ~Unlike you, I can't afford distractions right now.~
@53040 = ~Good luck finding something. Now if you'll excuse me, I've actual important matters to attend to.~
@53041 = ~Minsc! Yes! The perfect distraction. Great idea, <CHARNAME>. Thanks.~ [BD53041]
@53042 = ~Uh. Pretty desperately. On a scale of one to ten, around an eight. Hundred. Maybe eight hundred and fifty.~ [BD53042]
@53043 = ~I used to play ball ball. ~ [BD53043]
@53044 = ~"Ball ball"? What kind of sport is that?~
@53045 = ~Go play some ball ball then, and stop bothering me.~
@53046 = ~I'm leaving now. ~
@53047 = ~No, don't go. Please. Please, please, please, please, pleeeeeeease. ~ [BD53047]
@53048 = ~Just talk to me. That's all I ask. Just give me something to listen to other than—GODS, ADOY, SHUT THE HELLS UP OR I WILL KILL YOU IN A STRICTLY METAPHORICAL SENSE—*him*.~ [BD53048]
@53049 = ~What do you want to talk about?~
@53050 = ~I AM talking to you.~
@53051 = ~I don't need to point out how you sound when you speak to Adoy anymore at this point, do I?~
@53052 = ~You start with two balls, everyone stands in a circle, then you throw the first—~ [BD53052]
@53053 = ~Actually, never mind. Ball ball was terrible. I always lost ball ball, but I can't lose some things, CAN I, ADOY?~ [BD53053]
@53054 = ~You need a group to play ball ball, and a couple of balls—FOR THE LOVE OF GODS EVERYWHERE, LEAVE ME ALONE—and I always hated ball ball anyway.~ [BD53054]
@53055 = ~Fine! Fine. Leave me to suffer, then. I bet you'll be super happy when my brain starts leaking out of my ears BECAUSE SOMEONE WON'T SHUT UP!~ [BD53055]
@53056 = ~Oh, you're actually willing to do it? I didn't think you would. Hadn't thought that far ahead. ~ [BD53056]
@53057 = ~Right. Well. ~ [BD53057]
@53058 = ~I am teetering, <CHARNAME>.~ [BD53058]
@53059 = ~Caelar's crusade, hey? What's with that?~ [BD53059]
@53060 = ~Would that I knew. Her goals seem to be noble, but some of her actions continue to confound me.~
@53061 = ~Her conviction is impressive. Which is as nice a way to say she's utterly mad as I can think of.~
@53062 = ~I'm done wasting words on Caelar.~
@53063 = ~We don't need to understand her to—I'M IGNORING YOU—defeat her, though.~ [BD53063]
@53064 = ~That's what I like about you, <CHARNAME>. You always have a kind word, even for your enemies. Her conviction is really something. Yep. She's got a whole lot of conviction...~ [BD53064]
@53065 = ~Oh-kayyyy... That didn't work.~ [BD53065]
@53066 = ~Okay. This isn't working. ~ [BD53066]
@53067 = ~But I have an idea. Just work with me here...~
@53068 = ~What... are you doing?~
@53069 = ~Neera—I care for you. I do. But I don't want this to happen. Not like this. We'll get rid of Adoy, I promise you. You just need to hang on until then. Can you do that?~
@53070 = ~I think I might like this idea.~
@53071 = ~I don't think so. You're useful to me, so I indulge your eccentricities. But I'm not interested in you like that.~
@53072 = ~A girl throws herself at you, and this is how you respond? Gah! Why do you have to be so, so, so NOBLE?~ [BD53072]
@53073 = ~Shhh. Shhhhhhh. ~ [BD53073]
@53074 = ~Gods damn it. All right. Fine. Whatever. I'll talk to you later.~ [BD53074]
@53075 = ~Mmm... ~ [BD53075]
@53076 = ~Your lips taste of mead. How much have you had to drink?~
@53077 = ~Well, I'm certainly distracted. Did it work for you?~
@53078 = ~Now that's what I call a distraction...~
@53079 = ~Not enough. Nothing makes him go away. NOTHING. ~ [BD53079]
@53080 = ~Oh. Oh, gods, no. He ENJOYED that. HE enjoyed it. Ugh. NOT OKAY, ADOY. ~ [BD53080]
@53081 = ~Thanks for trying. Maybe when this is all over... you and I seem to work well together.~ [BD53081]
@53082 = ~We do, don't we?~
@53083 = ~You just need to hold on until we can get rid of Adoy. I know you can do it. You're one of the strongest people I've ever met. We are going to fix this, Neera. ~
@53084 = ~Are we done now? We've work to do.~
@53085 = ~We do. Just not when I've got a third wheel turning around and around and around in my brain. Someday, maybe, we can be really alone. Alone. That would be—that would be great.~ [BD53085]
@53086 = ~I hope you're right. I hope you're right SOON.~ [BD53086]
@53087 = ~Yes! Work. Let's do it!~ [BD53087]
@53088 = ~You know something, <CHARNAME>? ~ [BD53088]
@53089 = ~Some things. Never enough of them, though.~
@53090 = ~I know many things. I am a wise, wise man. ~
@53091 = ~Can it wait? We're kind of in a hurry here.~
@53092 = ~I know more than enough, and I've no inclination to add to that knowledge right now. If we have to chat, we can do it when Caelar's in the ground.~
@53093 = ~I like you. It's stuff like what you just said that makes me really glad that you're around.~ [BD53093]
@53094 = ~I want to say something serious, so I'm going to let that one pass. I'm really glad you're around. ~ [BD53094]
@53095 = ~It'll only take a second.~ [BD53095]
@53096 = ~I know I haven't been easy to get along with recently. Or, you know. Remain sane in the proximity of.~ [BD53096]
@53097 = ~It wasn't your fault, Neera. Adoy was driving you to distraction, and—~
@53098 = ~No problem. I'm more or less immune to insanity at this point.~
@53099 = ~I briefly considered running for the hills when we met, but now I'm glad I didn't.~
@53100 = ~Totally. You have no idea what it's like having someone interrupt you CONSTANTLY. The man never shuts up.~ [BD53100]
@53101 = ~Still, it couldn't have been fun. It certainly wasn't for me.~ [BD53101]
@53102 = ~I wouldn't have blamed you if you did abandon me.~ [BD53102]
@53103 = ~You stuck with me, though. So, thanks. You're the best.~ [BD53103]
@53104 = ~It's the least I can do for my favorite wild mage.~
@53105 = ~You know I'd do anything for you, Neera.~
@53106 = ~Perhaps not the best. Among the best, certainly. Top Five at least, I should think.~
@53107 = ~Did you have something you wanted to discuss other than the obvious?~
@53108 = ~I don't know how many wild mages you know, so that might not be much of a compliment. Still, I'm glad to hear it.~ [BD53108]
@53109 = ~I know. ~ [BD53109]
@53110 = ~And so modest to boot!~ [BD53110]
@53111 = ~You know, I was about to say something nice about you, but in retrospect I'm glad I didn't.~ [BD53111]
@53112 = ~No. I kinda regret talking as much as I did now.~ [BD53112]
@53113 = ~Go in, kill the enemy, get out, celebrate. Everything in life should be this straightforward. ~ [BD53113]
@53114 = ~It can't be?~
@53115 = ~Sounds like you've got something on your mind.~
@53116 = ~Simple pleasures are the best. And best enjoyed in silence. You understand?~
@53117 = ~Not in my world. Not at the moment, anyway.~ [BD53117]
@53118 = ~Yeah. Mostly the guy I recently got out of it.~ [BD53118]
@53119 = ~I'm just— What happened with Adoy is eating at me. How do you know when you've made the right decision, y'know?~ [BD53119]
@53120 = ~You can never know. Just do the best you can, and hope it's enough.~
@53121 = ~You know it's the right decision because it's the decision you made.~
@53122 = ~What's done is done. You can't let it bother you now.~
@53123 = ~Yeah. I understand. Forget I said anything. ~ [BD53123]
@53124 = ~Yeah. Hope.~ [BD53124]
@53125 = ~Is that how you do it? I wish I had your confidence.~ [BD53125]
@53126 = ~When I cut Adoy off, it felt like the right decision at the time. I still think it was. I hated feeling so—helpless.~ [BD53126]
@53127 = ~I couldn't DO anything for him. Wherever he was, he was trapped. The only thing he could do was drive me halfway to madness. ~ [BD53127]
@53128 = ~Exactly. He almost drove you insane. You did what you had to do.~
@53129 = ~You're lucky he didn't drive you further.~
@53130 = ~Better you than me.~
@53131 = ~I know. I know he didn't. I just wish I could have done something... more.~ [BD53131]
@53132 = ~I heard his every thought, but I couldn't do anything for him.~ [BD53132]
@53133 = ~Gee. Thanks.~ [BD53133]
@53134 = ~I'm tired of feeling helpless. I'm done with it. Next time, I WILL help. I will find a way.~ [BD53134]
@53135 = ~We're never gonna be safe again, are we?~ [BD53135]
@53136 = ~It's not looking likely, no.~
@53137 = ~Why would you want safe? Safe is boring. ~
@53138 = ~What brought this on?~
@53139 = ~Whining about it certainly won't make us any safer.~
@53140 = ~I always thought that one day—one shining, beautiful day—I could go fifteen minutes without having to worry about being killed. ~ [BD53140]
@53141 = ~Safe might be boring, but on the upside, it is safe.~ [BD53141]
@53142 = ~Our impending doom, mostly. ~ [BD53142]
@53143 = ~All right, I get it. Let's do this.~ [BD53143]
@53144 = ~It's stupid, I know.~ [BD53144]
@53145 = ~Wanting to be safe isn't stupid. It's healthy.~
@53146 = ~You are a wild mage. Danger is part of the package.~
@53147 = ~It makes no difference where you are. There's always danger. Always. Never think otherwise.~
@53148 = ~Yeah, but me being who I am, the world being as it is... There's always gonna be something dangerous and scary and murder-y around.~ [BD53148]
@53149 = ~True. I am what I am, and being in mortal peril's part of that.~ [BD53149]
@53150 = ~I was fooling myself. But not any longer. ~ [BD53150]
@53151 = ~Thanks, <CHARNAME>. Let's do this.~ [BD53151]
@53152 = ~And it's not gonna stop me, not anymore. Not ever again. Let's do this.~ [BD53152]
@53153 = ~I never thought I'd be so happy to see a normal, non-lava-spewing basement.~ [BD53153]
@53154 = ~Not that I had any doubts we'd see a normal, non-lava-spewing basement again, mind you. We are GOOD. Almost too good.~ [BD53154]
@53155 = ~You were very good.~
@53156 = ~I'm okay. You—you were fantastic, Neera. I couldn't have done this without you. Beauty, brains, and—something else that starts with B. Bewitching. You've got it all.~
@53157 = ~ 'Twas a passable effort.~
@53158 = ~Good isn't good enough. I shall be great, or nothing.~
@53159 = ~We just killed a devil and walked out of one of the Nine Hells. That's pretty great if you ask me. But nobody did, so shutting up now.~ [BD53159]
@53160 = ~Oh, I'm just getting started.~ [BD53160]
@53161 = ~You silver-tongued dev—actually, I think I saw a silver-tongued devil a couple hours ago. It didn't look nearly as good as you.~
@53162 = ~Passable, huh? How about I make you passably pink?~ [BD53162]
@53163 = ~...Actually, never mind. I don't think the crowd would appreciate you being pink as much as I would.~ [BD53163]
@53164 = ~I certainly wouldn't.~
@53165 = ~You're a smart woman, Neera.~
@53166 = ~I don't know. Pink looks pretty fetching on me.~
@53167 = ~Would it kill you to be serious for once in your life?~
@53168 = ~Well, excuuuuuse me. We just killed a devil and walked out of one of the Nine Hells. I don't know about you, but I'M gonna celebrate.~ [BD53168]
@53169 = ~I'll save that one for another time. ~ [BD53169]
@53170 = ~You're just figuring that out now? Shame on you, <CHARNAME>. Shaaaame. You're lucky I'm in a forgiving mood.~ [BD53170]
@53171 = ~I bet it does. I think you'd look VERY fetching in pink undergarments. And even better without them.~ [BD53171]
@53172 = ~Come here, you. ~ [BD53172]
@53173 = ~Whatever you say, O mighty one.~
@53174 = ~If you insist.~
@53175 = ~Neera... There are people here...~
@53176 = ~I can't, Neera. I don't feel that way about you.~
@53177 = ~...Oh. I thought... Well, I guess it doesn't matter what I thought. ~ [BD53177]
@53178 = ~I'm sorry, Neera. I didn't mean to lead you on.~
@53179 = ~Not really. In the greater scheme of things, it matters little what anyone thinks.~
@53180 = ~No, no. You have nothing to apologize for. I'm the one who— Sorry, I misunderstood things, I guess.~ [BD53180]
@53181 = ~I see. I guess I'll just— Excuse me. ~ [BD53181]
@53182 = ~Friends?~ [BD53182]
@53183 = ~Always.~
@53184 = ~Well, yeah, I hope so.~
@53185 = ~Allies.~
@53186 = ~That's good enough for me.~ [BD53186]
@53187 = ~Well, I won't say that I'm not disappointed, but if that's what you want—if that's ALL you want—then it'll have to do.~ [BD53187]
@53188 = ~If that's the way you want it, I guess I'll have to live with it. Have a good night, <CHARNAME>.~ [BD53188]
@53189 = ~Mmm...~ [BD53189]
@53190 = ~So? ~ [BD53190]
@53191 = ~I like you, <CHARNAME>. I think I like you a lot.~ [BD53191]
@53192 = ~I like you, Neera. A little more than a lot.~
@53193 = ~Is that what you think?~
@53194 = ~And who can blame you?~
@53195 = ~I see. That's... nice.~
@53196 = ~Good. ~ [BD53196]
@53197 = ~You bet your pretty little butt. ~ [BD53197]
@53198 = ~I'm glad you think so.~ [BD53198]
@53199 = ~When this is over—when everything here is done—maybe the two of us could go somewhere, you know... a little quieter. More private.~ [BD53199]
