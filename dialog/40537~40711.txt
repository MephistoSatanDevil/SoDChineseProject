@40537 = ~It's hard to describe. If you want to know, you'll just have to go look.~
@40538 = ~No, my fishy friends—I cannot. I will not subject you to the unspeakable horror that lurks beyond yon door. For your sake, you must remain here. Don't go out there—not if you value your sanity.~
@40539 = ~The horror outside is nothing compared to what awaits you should you remain here. Out of my way, you trout-faced cullions!~
@40540 = ~Hmmm...~
@40541 = ~I want to see it.~
@40542 = ~You can see it after me! Me first, me! ME!~
@40543 = ~No, Gurgle! Me first! Me! ME!~
@40544 = ~Ah, now THAT's some good alliteration!~ [BD40544]
@40545 = ~The <PRO_RACE> wants to kill us, Gurgle. What should we do?~
@40546 = ~Stupid Floss. We kill the <PRO_RACE>.~
@40547 = ~That's what I thought. I just wanted to check and make sure.~
@40548 = ~WHAT? No, no, you go back, back like all the others. You go back or we kill you, yes, that's what we'll do.~
@40549 = ~Please, I don't want to fight. Can I do nothing to convince you to let me pass?~
@40550 = ~Surely we can find some middle ground here—some place that won't see one of us horribly slaughter the two of you.~
@40551 = ~Stand aside, you wretched worms. Stand aside or face my wrath!~
@40552 = ~Huh?~
@40553 = ~Quiet, Floss! The <PRO_RACE> wants to bargain. But what does it have we want?~
@40554 = ~I know! Tell us a story, <PRO_RACE>. Tell us a story and we'll let you pass.~
@40555 = ~Hmmm... I don't know...~
@40556 = ~Tell us a story, <PRO_RACE>. Tell us a story and we'll let you pass.~
@40557 = ~Shut up, Floss! Don't tell it what we want.~
@40558 = ~Why not?~
@40559 = ~I said shut up. Now you, <PRO_RACE>—you were going to tell us a story.~
@40560 = ~Of course, of course. Once upon a time, there were two children. Half-siblings, born to the same father.~
@40561 = ~Sure, a story. I can do that. Let's see... All right. Once upon a time, there was a girl, a bright and precocious girl who many said was destined for great things.~
@40562 = ~I'll tell you no tales, sahuagin. But in your death you'll become a part of mine. A small part, admittedly, but it is a great story, epic in scope and unparalleled in its grandeur.~
@40563 = ~Huh?~
@40564 = ~It threatens us, Floss! Kill it! Kill the <PRO_RACE>!~
@40565 = ~A sahuagin girl?~
@40566 = ~Perhaps. There was some dispute over her heritage. Some said she was a child of the gods, an aasimar. Some believed she was just a human. Perhaps, in truth, she was a sahuagin. Little was known of her but her legend.~
@40567 = ~No, not a sahuagin girl. Who's telling the story here?~
@40568 = ~There was a chance I was going to let you live through this, sahuagin. You just lost that chance.~
@40569 = ~You are. But I don't like it much. ~
@40570 = ~Do you want me to tell you the legend of Caelar or not?~
@40571 = ~You're right. I'm not a great storyteller. I am, however, great at killing things. Get the hells out of my way or you'll find out how great.~
@40572 = ~There was a chance of you living through this, fishman. You just lost that chance.~
@40573 = ~Her legend? What legend? ~
@40574 = ~She was to have been a great paladin. But something happened to her. Something dark twisted inside her, pulling her from the path she was supposed to walk.~
@40575 = ~Typical hero stuff. You know, she was the chosen one, great things were foreseen for her, but it all fell apart and she took a turn down the wrong path.~
@40576 = ~A legend that ends with me standing over her dead body. As I shall stand over yours in a moment's time.~
@40577 = ~Path? What path? ~
@40578 = ~The path of evil. A path that saw the entire Sword Coast thrown into disarray.~
@40579 = ~A crooked path, where good and evil were no longer distinct. A gray path that turned darker the further along it she walked.~
@40580 = ~Her path is no concern of yours. You should focus on your path, for it is at an end.~
@40581 = ~What path is that?~
@40582 = ~The path of righteousness and virtue—the path of the paladin. Instead of walking this path, she chose another. And because of it, everywhere she went, bloodshed and war followed in her footsteps.~
@40583 = ~The hero's path. Fighting evil, liberating the downtrodden, and the like. That was what she was supposed to do, but that's not what happened.~
@40584 = ~Her path is no concern of yours. You should focus on your path, for it is at an end.~
@40585 = ~What happened next?~
@40586 = ~Tell us, <PRO_RACE>! What happened next?~
@40587 = ~It wasn't enough for her to spread chaos where she went—she sent others to sow it in far-off cities. In one such city, she sent men to try and kill a child of Bhaal who'd attracted her attention.~
@40588 = ~She tried to have me killed.~
@40589 = ~I'll tell you what happens next—no, better still, I'll SHOW you the bloody fate that awaits her.~
@40590 = ~Why would she do that? ~
@40591 = ~Someone doubtless knows, but they haven't told me. Not yet. But they will, for I am the one they tried to kill. I will find Caelar Argent, and on that day she will answer for all her crimes.~
@40592 = ~Some people have to kick the hornet's nest, just to see if they'll get stung. And she will get stung, in the end.~
@40593 = ~Because she is a fool. When I get my hands on her, she will be a dead fool.~
@40594 = ~WHEN you get your hands on her?~
@40595 = ~The story's not over?~
@40596 = ~Not yet.~
@40597 = ~No. It seems to have gone off on a bit of a tangent. But I have faith it'll pick up the plot in short order.~
@40598 = ~It will be soon. But if you don't stand aside, you'll not live long enough to hear the end.~
@40599 = ~I don't like it.~
@40600 = ~But <PRO_HESHE> did tell us a story, and we did say we'd let <PRO_HIMHER> pass if <PRO_HESHE> did that.~
@40601 = ~It's got no ending!~
@40602 = ~It's still a story.~
@40603 = ~Meh. All right. You may pass, <PRO_RACE>. But you should learn some proper stories if you want to pass through here again.~
@40604 = ~You should've let ol' Voghiln tell them a story, <CHARNAME>. Never send a Bhaalspawn to do a skald's job.~ [BD40604]
@40605 = ~Next time, let me tell the story, <CHARNAME>. I've got some that'd curl their flippers.~ [BD40605]
@40606 = ~Sahuagin half-siblings.~
@40607 = ~Yes, they were. Have you heard this story? I won't tell it if you've heard it before.~
@40608 = ~No, not sahuagin half-siblings. Who's telling the story here?~
@40609 = ~That does it. You are two dead fish-people.~
@40610 = ~You are. But I don't like it much. ~
@40611 = ~Do you want me to tell you the tale of the Bhaalspawn or not?~
@40612 = ~I'll admit I'm not a great storyteller. I am, however, great at killing things. So get the hells out of my way now.~
@40613 = ~We want to hear it, we want to hear it. Tell us the tale of the half-kin. ~
@40614 = ~I never said they were half-brothers. One was a woman. Their father was a very evil man—not a man, even, but a god.~
@40615 = ~Their father was a very evil man—not a man, even, but a god.~
@40616 = ~I'd rather tell the tale of the dead sahuagin.~
@40617 = ~No, no, no, no, no, we haven't heard it. Tell the story; tell us about the two sahuagin half-kin.~
@40618 = ~I never said they were half-brothers. One was a woman. Their father was a very evil man—not a man, even, but a god.~
@40619 = ~Their father was a very evil man—not a man, even, but a god.~
@40620 = ~I'd rather tell the tale of the dead sahuagin.~
@40621 = ~Oooo, a god, that is interesting. Go on, go on. ~
@40622 = ~One of the children grew to be an evil man, like their father.~
@40623 = ~One of the brothers grew to be an evil man, like their father.~
@40624 = ~No. I lived this story once, and that was once too often. I've no desire to go over it again.~
@40625 = ~Story time is over. I'm done here, sahuagin. Let me pass or suffer the consequences.~
@40626 = ~You promised us a story! ~
@40627 = ~Perhaps you'd like to hear the tale of Caelar Argent—a bright and precocious girl who was destined for great things.~
@40628 = ~I changed my mind. Get out of my way, or I'll change your mind into a bloody smear on this cavern wall.~
@40629 = ~He was a god? ~
@40630 = ~No, he wasn't. But he aspired to be one. And to do so, he plotted and schemed and manipulated the world from the shadows.~
@40631 = ~He wasn't a god, but not for lack of trying. His goal was to take what he believed was his rightful place, as the Lord of Murder.~
@40632 = ~He was the son of a dead god. Like his father, he died.~
@40633 = ~Eep! Did he... did he succeed? ~
@40634 = ~Nearly so. It was only his heroic half-sister that prevented him from reaching his sinister goals.~
@40635 = ~He almost did. It was only his heroic half-brother who stopped him.~
@40636 = ~No. For I was there to stop him.~
@40637 = ~Sometimes, it takes great evil to stop great evil. So it was in this instance. Only one person could stop the villainous Sarevok, and that was his diabolical sister, <CHARNAME>.~
@40638 = ~Sometimes, it takes great evil to stop great evil. So it was in this instance. Only one person could stop the villainous Sarevok, and that was his diabolical brother, <CHARNAME>.~
@40639 = ~<CHARNAME>? Doesn't sound so bad.~
@40640 = ~Shut up, Floss!~
@40641 = ~Wait—you're part of this story?~
@40642 = ~Shut up, Floss! You're mucking up the story. Go on, tell us more.~
@40643 = ~The two siblings fought a great battle. The earth trembled beneath their feet and the sky wept for fear of the power on display. For days they fought, or so it seemed. And finally, one fell.~
@40644 = ~The half-brothers fought a great battle. The earth trembled beneath their feet and the sky wept for fear of the power on display. For days they fought, or so it seemed. And finally, one fell.~
@40645 = ~Not much more to tell, really. We fought, I won, he died. End of story.~
@40646 = ~The tale continues to this day. In the most recent chapter, its protagonist strikes down two sahuagin foolish enough to stand in <PRO_HISHER> way.~
@40647 = ~That's it? That's your story? ~
@40648 = ~Which one? WHICH ONE?! ~
@40649 = ~ 'Twas Sarevok who died that day. His plots and schemes came to nothing when he faced <CHARNAME>'s power. But <CHARNAME> was not left unaffected. To this day, <PRO_HESHE> still dreams of blood and darkness and death. The screams of those <PRO_HESHE> and Sarevok killed still ring in <PRO_HISHER> ears.~
@40650 = ~I'll give you a hint: The one who fell wasn't me.~
@40651 = ~The one who isn't here to kill you this <DAYNIGHTALL>.~
@40652 = ~Uhhh... What?~
@40653 = ~Oh. It must be terrible for <PRO_HIMHER>.~
@40654 = ~It is. And that is the tale of me and my half-brother Sarevok.~
@40655 = ~Well... <PRO_HESHE>'s getting used to it. Whether that's a good thing or not, I cannot say.~
@40656 = ~It is. But not so terrible as it will be for you if you cross <PRO_HIMHER>. For you see, I AM <CHARNAME>!~
@40657 = ~AAAAHHHH! It's <PRO_HIMHER>, Floss! It's <PRO_HIMHER>! Flee! FLEE!~
@40658 = ~You were one of the god's children? This story was about you?~
@40659 = ~It was. ~
@40660 = ~It was a good story. ~
@40661 = ~It was a good story. Tell us another one, <PRO_RACE>.~
@40662 = ~You said you'd let me pass if I told you a story. I've told you a story. Let me pass, please.~
@40663 = ~I'll tell you the tale of the Two Horribly Slaughtered Sahuagin in the Cavern We're Standing In if you don't let me go on my way.~
@40664 = ~Fair's fair, Gurgle. Here, <PRO_RACE>. You told a good story, you deserve this.~
@40665 = ~Oh, you're still here? Tell us another story. Come on, tell us. ~
@40666 = ~One story's enough. Leave me be.~
@40667 = ~I'm afraid I'm all out of stories.~
@40668 = ~Do not make demands of me, amphibian. You won't like what you get.~
@40669 = ~Ah, you're no fun at all, are you? ~
@40670 = ~Why're you still here? ~
@40671 = ~I just want to look around.~
@40672 = ~I've been asking myself the same question.~
@40673 = ~Mind your tone, fishman.~
@40674 = ~Look. Look there, and there, and there, there, there, and... there. All right, you've looked around. Now get out.~
@40675 = ~Get out. Get out!~
@40676 = ~Well, ask it somewhere else. This is our cavern. Get out.~
@40677 = ~Did you do it? Are the sahuagin dead? ~
@40678 = ~They are dealt with.~
@40679 = ~I said it, and I did it. The fishfolk will bother you no more.~
@40680 = ~Go see for yourself. I've better things to do than talk with the likes of you.~
@40681 = ~Thank you! Thank you! May the Blessed Lady shine her light upon you always!~
@40682 = ~Careful, friend. You don't want trouble with us, believe me.~
@40683 = ~Gods! The sahuagin attack! Slay them! ~
@40684 = ~Gah! Smoothskins! ~
@40685 = ~Floss! There's another one! Watch out!~
@40686 = ~The sahuagin are gone. They must have grown bored of this place.~
@40687 = ~Can you blame them?~
@40688 = ~Could be the Shinies killed them. Take care.~
@40689 = ~Where are the fishfolk?~
@40690 = ~Somewhere else.~
@40691 = ~They've got the right idea.~
@40692 = ~Enough chatter. We've work to do. Let's go.~
@40693 = ~It seems the sahuagin have fled. I'll have to find something else to eat.~
@40694 = ~You're joking. Right? Tell me you're joking.~
@40695 = ~I don't think he's joking.~
@40696 = ~Gods! This is-is a b-bad end for the cavern guards.~
@40697 = ~Evil to they who do evil.~
@40698 = ~But did they truly do evil? These crusaders seem to believe in the righteousness of their cause.~
@40699 = ~They stand against us. That's evil enough for me. Let's go.~
@40700 = ~Such carnage... Pure katrill.~
@40701 = ~Yes. A gloriously bloody slaughter, from the looks of it.~
@40702 = ~Bloody. Don't know about glorious.~
@40703 = ~I'll not shed tears for fallen enemies. Let's go.~
@40704 = ~Looks like we missed the fun. And I am completely comfortable with that being the case.~ [BD40704]
@40705 = ~I'm completely at peace with that.~
@40706 = ~Is anyone else hungry? I crave fish.~ [BD40706]
@40707 = ~You never stop, do you?~
@40708 = ~That's what the ladies say. Ho ho ho.~
@40709 = ~If any gods can hear my words, I pray to you, take me now...~
@40710 = ~Get out of here. That's a tall tale if ever I heard one.~
@40711 = ~A tall tale? Best not let the captain hear you talk like that. And look at the marks on the walls if you don't believe me.~
