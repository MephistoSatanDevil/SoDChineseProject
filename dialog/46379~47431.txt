@46382 = ~My dog could do a better job than Eltan!~
@46383 = ~Keep your voices down!~
@46384 = ~I have several ideas to improve the city's operations.~
@46385 = ~Oh, it's you again. We're still closed.~ [BD46385]
@46386 = ~I lost three heirlooms that meant everything to me in the fire. And my wife left me. Took the kids with her to Baldur's Gate.~
@46387 = ~I might already have one of your items. I need to check my pack.~
@46388 = ~How many have you found?~
@46389 = ~One.~
@46390 = ~Two.~
@46391 = ~Well, keep looking! The rest must be out there!~
@46392 = ~Here, take this shield. It's the one you were asking about, the one belonging to the halfling. Return it to him with my apologies.~
@46393 = ~What can I get for you?~
@46394 = ~Let's see what you have.~
@46395 = ~Nothing right now.~
@46396 = ~Fine wines by the tallglass.~
@46397 = ~Have a good <DAYNIGHTALL>, then.~
@46398 = ~The crusade's really starting to mass up north. They've been conscripting villagers from towns they pass through.~
@46399 = ~I hear the crusade's made it all the way to Boareskyr Bridge. That's where Bhaal and Cyric fought, you know.~
@46400 = ~Some nobles rented out a room upstairs for the night. One room for three people. Makes you wonder, eh?~
@46401 = ~They say there's a secret door in the Flaming Fist headquarters. Leads into the sewers, apparently.~
@46402 = ~Duke Entar's daughter is growing up to be quite a handful, I hear.~
@46403 = ~A very good <DAYNIGHTALL> to you. Can I get you something from the bar?~
@46404 = ~Sure, what do you have?~
@46405 = ~Not right now, thanks.~
@46406 = ~Nothing to drink right now. Tell me, do you ever have trouble with the patrons here? ~
@46407 = ~What's the story with Sallo?~
@46408 = ~Mostly wine, but we also have a few casks of mead.~
@46409 = ~Let me know if you need anything.~
@46410 = ~Not usually. Bellowglyn runs the inn well. Our patrons know better than to drink too much or start a fight.~
@46411 = ~You're a beautiful woman, though. You must get a lot of attention.~
@46412 = ~Now and then you must get some troublemakers, though.~
@46413 = ~Good to know. What do you serve here?~
@46414 = ~Well, aren't you a charmer? The other servers here and I are all experienced hunters. We can take care of ourselves.~
@46415 = ~I believe you. Can I buy you a drink?~

@46421 = ~I believe you. Thanks for the information, I have to be going now.~
@46422 = ~I'm afraid I don't drink with patrons. That's no reason for you not to have one, though.~
@46423 = ~Sure, what do you have?~
@46424 = ~Not right now, thanks.~
@46425 = ~That sort of talk isn't appreciated here. Do you want a drink or not?~
@46426 = ~Sure, what do you have?~
@46427 = ~Not right now, thanks.~
@46428 = ~Oh, <PRO_HESHE>'s a regular. Drinks too much but never fights or gets out of control. Just sleeps it off behind the bar.~
@46429 = ~I see. What do you have to drink here?~
@46430 = ~Do you ever have trouble with the patrons here? ~
@46431 = ~Thanks for the information. I have to be going now.~

@46440 = ~Since I can't speak to the creatures or see them very well, that's going to be hard.~
@46441 = ~How exactly am I going to do that?~
@46442 = ~You'll just have to do your best. Look at them like, does this thing look like a monster? Is it gonna eat me? Or can I maybe talk to it?~ [BD46442]
@46443 = ~We'll see what happens. Thanks, Zaviak.~
@46444 = ~My mind is blown, man. I'll see you later.~
@46445 = ~That advice was almost less than useless.~
@46446 = ~Later.~ [BD46446]
@46447 = ~Tongueblister~
@46448 = ~This looks like the right wine. I'm taking it.~
@46449 = ~I'll take this wine and leave payment for it. 50 gold should be right.~
@46450 = ~This doesn't look like the right wine.~
@46451 = ~You take the wine.~
@46452 = ~You take the wine and leave the gold in its place.~
@46453 = ~You leave the wine where it is.~
@46454 = ~Yes, I have it here.~
@46455 = ~What the... this isn't ruby wine! This is boring old regular wine! I told you, ruby wine has a sharp, spicy scent. Now go back and get the right stuff!~
@46456 = ~I told you, ruby wine has a really sharp, spicy smell. Now go back and get the right stuff!~
@46457 = ~Is there someone out there?~
@46458 = ~Who's in there?~

@46461 = ~No one interested in speaking to a prisoner of the Grand Dukes. Farewell, whoever you are.~
@46462 = ~I've found a key near here that may work.~
@46463 = ~You've got to let me out of here.~
@46464 = ~Easier said than done. The door's locked.~
@46465 = ~~
@46466 = ~Give me a moment, I'll see if I can find a key.~
@46467 = ~I could do that... for the right price.~
@46468 = ~"Got to"? No. I've "got to" do nothing. Fare thee well.~
@46469 = ~No! Please, you've got to help me!~
@46470 = ~There must be a key out there somewhere. Find it and let me out!~
@46471 = ~Bide a moment, I'll see if I can find one.~
@46472 = ~Probably, but I've better things to do than look for it. Farewell.~
@46473 = ~What's in it for me if I do?~
@46474 = ~I've got 150 gold pieces. Get me out of here and they're yours.~
@46475 = ~Done. Stand back, I'll see what I can do about the door.~
@46476 = ~Wait a moment. I'll see if I can find a key.~
@46477 = ~Not enough.~
@46478 = ~300 gold! I'll have to go to the Fist headquarters to fetch it, but I can give you 300 gold.~
@46479 = ~You're a member of the Fist? Why didn't you say so? Let me see what I can do about this lock.~
@46480 = ~You're a member of the Fist? Why didn't you say so? Let me see what I can do about this door.~
@46481 = ~You're with the Flaming Fist? Why didn't you say so? Bide a moment, I'll see if I can find a key for the door.~
@46482 = ~Not nearly enough. Enjoy your incarceration.~
@46483 = ~Do it quickly. I may be safer in here than you are out there.~
@46484 = ~I'm an officer of the Flaming Fist. You've got to get me out of here!~
@46485 = ~How did you get in there?~
@46486 = ~You're a member of the Fist? Why didn't you say so? Let me see what I can do about this door.~
@46487 = ~The Flaming Fist, eh? Bide a moment, I'll see if I can find a key for the door.~
@46488 = ~A Flaming Fist mercenary locked up in the basement of the Ducal Palace? What the hells happened here?~
@46489 = ~I'll tell you when you open the door. Find the key, quickly. I may be safer in here than you are out there.~
@46490 = ~I believe you promised me some gold?~
@46491 = ~She's been stopped. My gold?~
@46492 = ~"Westgate Ruby Wine"~
@46493 = ~You've returned. Do you have the scroll? ~
@46494 = ~I do.~
@46495 = ~Here it is. You know how to use it? Because I don't.~
@46496 = ~How much is it worth to you?~
@46497 = ~I do. Baeloth, if you'd be so kind as to negate the stone's effects?~
@46498 = ~That, and someone who knows how to use it. Edwin?~
@46499 = ~Yes. Dynaheir, could you please put an end to this dark magic once and for all?~
@46500 = ~Praise Lathander! And you, of course, <CHARNAME>. Do you know how to use the scroll, or shall I? ~
@46501 = ~I believe I can.~
@46502 = ~I haven't the first clue how to use it. Do you?~
@46503 = ~~
@46504 = ~Do it, then. We've suffered enough.~
@46505 = ~I have some knowledge in this arena. I should be able to close the spell, if not reverse its effects.~
@46506 = ~It is done.~
@46507 = ~Thank you.~
@46508 = ~Will you truly see us die for no good reason?~
@46509 = ~No, of course not. Here, take it.~
@46510 = ~No, but I absolutely will watch you die unless I receive 500 gold reasons. Good value all around, I'd say.~
@46511 = ~I would sacrifice anyone's life if it were to my benefit.~
@46512 = ~It would be my mildly put-upon pleasure.~
@46513 = ~If I can cross Vichand any way, I bless myself every way.~
@46514 = ~As thou wishes it.~
@46515 = ~Damn it! You drove us to this, <CHARNAME>! Get <PRO_HIMHER>! Get the scroll, whatever the cost!~
@46516 = ~I'd like to speak with you on the matter of a stolen ham. ~
@46517 = ~You want to know about Mattroun, then. ~
@46518 = ~You believe he committed the theft.~
@46519 = ~You saw him take the ham?~
@46520 = ~He insists he's innocent. You saw him take the ham?~
@46521 = ~I know quite enough of him.~
@46522 = ~Don't see how anyone else could've. ~
@46523 = ~Tell me what happened.~
@46524 = ~Nobody could have snuck past you? You're absolutely certain of this?~
@46525 = ~You display a woeful lack of imagination, then.~
@46526 = ~Didn't see him take it, but I would've seen if anyone else had. I was here working the forge the whole time, he was right round the corner. I heard him snoring for a while, but I figure he needs the sleep, and if anyone comes 'round, I'm here, right?~
@46527 = ~Didn't see him take it, but I would've seen if anyone else had.~
@46528 = ~No one else came around. But the grain bags were torn open and the ham was gone. If Mattroun didn't do it, whoever did would have to be invisible or shorter than I am to sneak past me while I was at the forge.~
@46529 = ~Now if you'll excuse me, I've got work to do.~
@46530 = ~I come with a warning, smith. The crusade has targeted you for death.~
@46531 = ~What arms and armor do you have available?~
@46532 = ~I believe we're done.~
@46533 = ~Well... You never say never, right? But whoever did it would've had to've been invisible, or shorter than I am to sneak past me while I was at the forge.~
@46534 = ~I do, do I? Well, that may be so, but I know what I see and I know what I didn't see.~
@46535 = ~I'd like to speak with you about some stolen food.~
@46536 = ~Jegg? Are you here? I've a sword that needs repair! Jegg?~
@46537 = ~Is this him? Is this the assassin?~
@46538 = ~Please, keep your voice down. The spy will be revealed, but we must give them a chance...~
@46539 = ~For the love of the gods, be quiet!~
@46540 = ~Be silent, you idiot woman!~
@46541 = ~Ho! You've a smart tongue! It's the smartest thing about you!~
@46542 = ~Is anyone here?~
@46543 = ~I'm here, and I need silence! Take your shouting elsewhere, you useless nit!~
@46544 = ~There's no one here.~
@46545 = ~Jegg? Is that you?~
@46546 = ~Aye, it's me.~
@46547 = ~What are you doing?~
@46548 = ~Whatever she was doing, it's over now.~
@46549 = ~Wasting a potion of invisibility, that's what she was doing.~
@46550 = ~Nothing. She's doing nothing.~
@46551 = ~Is everything all right?~
@46552 = ~It's fine, Roark. <CHARNAME> here got it in <PRO_HISHER> head I was in some sort of danger. Stuff and nonsense.~
@46553 = ~Danger? Are you sure everything's all right?~
@46554 = ~Don't fuss over me, man! Get back on the walls and keep the bloody crusade out!~
@46555 = ~Hillcarver! You here?~
@46556 = ~Aye, I'm here all right. Make your move, assassin.~
@46557 = ~Please, Mistress Hillcarver—you're going to give the game away.~
@46558 = ~Will you please shut the hells up?!~
@46559 = ~Still your fool tongue or I swear I'll cut it from your skulll!~
@46560 = ~Ho, you give me lip? Who needs you?~
@46561 = ~Jegg Hillcarver, smithy of Bridgefort! Are you here?~
@46562 = ~I'm trying to concentrate, you idiot! Do you want to die at the hands of the crusade's magicians? No? Then shut the hells up and let me work in peace!~
@46563 = ~Bloody dwarves. Act like they live to work and never around when you need 'em...~
@46564 = ~Hillcarver? I hear your voice, but I can't see you...~
@46565 = ~I'm over here. And I'm done with this bloody nonsense.~
@46566 = ~What are you doing?~
@46567 = ~Whatever she was doing, it's over now.~
@46568 = ~Wasting a potion of invisibility, that's what she was doing.~
@46569 = ~Nothing. She's doing nothing.~
@46570 = ~No, no, no, no. You don't put a stone of elnath in a potion of invisibility. It just isn't done.~
@46571 = ~But why isn't it done?~
@46572 = ~Because invisible explosions are the worst kind.~
@46573 = ~There's no proof that's what would happen.~
@46574 = ~That's because the evidence was incinerated by the explosion!~
@46575 = ~Forgive us if we are disturbing you, my <PRO_LADYLORD>. My young colleague and I sometimes let our passion get the better of us.~
@46576 = ~Greetings. I am Elandro. This is Thirrim. We were just discussing—it matters not. A trivial matter to anyone without a special interest in the arcane arts.~
@46577 = ~There is no crime in being passionate about one's craft. My name is <CHARNAME>.~
@46578 = ~A pleasure to meet you. Is there anything I can do for you?~
@46579 = ~If you say so. For what it's worth, I think you're right—dousing a stone of elnath in invisibility potion is a bad idea. An explosively bad idea.~
@46580 = ~No, please continue. It was fascinating. I am <CHARNAME>, by the way.~
@46581 = ~I don't have time for this. In the future, stay out of my way.~
@46582 = ~If every mage felt as you two do, we'd never have discovered the Weave at all.~
@46583 = ~Feel free to test your theory, but please, do us the courtesy of waiting until there are no others of worth nearby.~ [BD46583]
@46584 = ~I have neither a potion of invisibility nor a stone of elnath, so it's all academic anyway. But never mind that.~
@46585 = ~I don't recognize you, <PRO_SIRMAAM>. Are you new to this place?~
@46586 = ~I've only just arrived.~
@46587 = ~I've not been here long, no.~
@46588 = ~New enough.~
@46589 = ~Can you tell us anything about what transpires beyond these walls? ~
@46590 = ~Caelar's crusade wreaks havoc across the Sword Coast. Coast Way Crossing is destroyed. Some fear she will do the same to Boareskyr Bridge.~
@46591 = ~Only that you're better off within them than without, unless you want to swear fealty to the Shining Lady.~
@46592 = ~Precious little.~
@46593 = ~I care little for politics.~
@46594 = ~We shall endeavor to do so.~
@46595 = ~We can do that? Why am I only just learning of this?~ [BD46595]
@46596 = ~You do not want to do that, my lady. Caelar's crusade is folly. She leads her followers to their doom. It is only a question of how many others they take with them.~ [BD46596]
@46597 = ~I'm with you, friend. I am more concerned about what awaits us should the crusade penetrate our defenses.~
@46598 = ~Wynan Hess is a good man. He'll keep the worst of it out.~
@46599 = ~Wynan Hess?~
@46600 = ~I hope you're right.~
@46601 = ~Would that he had. Do you not feel a subtle decline, both in health and morale? The crusade has landed a spellstone in the fort. A negative energy field is slowly killing all around us.~
@46602 = ~Now that you mention it, I have. I thought it simply a matter of fatigue. ~
@46603 = ~Far from it. The crusade has landed a spellstone in the fort. It emits a negative energy field that is slowly killing all around it.~
@46604 = ~Would that it were. I am doing all that I can to resolve the matter.~
@46605 = ~Keep on thinking that. You'll sleep better.~
@46606 = ~Have a care, <CHARNAME>. Thou'rt frightening these men, to no good purpose.~ [BD46606]
@46607 = ~Fear's good. Makes you careful. Keeps you alive.~ [BD46607]
@46608 = ~Gods! We are doomed!~
@46609 = ~All mortals die one day, but I'm doing everything I can to ensure that for those who take refuge in Bridgefort, that day is a long time coming.~
@46610 = ~Take heart, friend. All mortals die, but I'm doing everything in my power to ensure that day will be a long time coming for all who take refuge in Bridgefort.~
@46611 = ~Yes. Well, *you're* doomed. I'm not so eager to declare defeat.~
@46612 = ~Oh, I bet the ladies can't get enough of you...~
@46613 = ~That is a distinct possibility.~
@46614 = ~The only defeat is surrender. To fight, win or lose, is a victory of a sort.~
@46615 = ~Fighting and losing may be victory of a sort, but all things considered, I believe I'd be happier with the sort of victory that involves me winning.~
@46616 = ~Then we are in your debt.~
@46617 = ~Or we would be, were you able to do anything about the negative energy field. Canceling a spellstone's enchantment is all but impossible without the original scroll that powered it. In the best of all worlds, it would still be beyond anyone's reach in the crusade camp. I said we were doomed, and I've heard nothing to make me rethink that judgment.~
@46618 = ~Tell your simpering monkey to calm himself. The spellstone will be dealt with, as will the one who made it. He will be dealt with harshly indeed.~
@46619 = ~Please try not to agitate Elandro. Strong emotions can sometimes draw in evil creatures, and we don't need any more threats at the moment. ~
@46620 = ~Bridgefort's most powerful magician, gods help us. He maintains the wards that keep the crusade from wiping us off the map, but he is an old man. He'll not be able to maintain the shields much longer, I fear. Should his concentration lapse even for a moment, we are all of us doomed.~
@46621 = ~Then we are in your debt.~
@46622 = ~You are alchemists, ja? Voghiln has an idea how you might repay that debt. Have you heard of a brew called Luskan's Bane?~
@46623 = ~Can you think of nothing but your next drink?~
@46624 = ~Not nothing. But not much, either. Perhaps the ebon-skinned beauty would like to give me something else to consider for a time?~
@46625 = ~I'll give you a dagger in your back, you blubber-covered wael. Consider that. ~
@46626 = ~In <PRO_HISHER> debt? But <PRO_HESHE> hasn't done anything, at least nothing that I can see. Gods, the walls, I can feel them closing in around me. This is no fortress; it is a tomb!~
@46627 = ~All our lives in that doddering fool's withered claws... We're doomed. That's it. What in the hells are we going to do now? What will we do?~
@46628 = ~I've not slept a wink in five nights. The crusade will take us and kill us, or worse. We are doomed. Doomed!~
@46629 = ~Our fates are sealed.~
@46630 = ~Please, Elandro, don't start with this again. Think about potions of invisibility and volatile alchemical reactions. Too much fear and despair can summon unwanted creatures, especially at night.~
@46631 = ~What's the point, Thirrim? What is the point? I'm at my wit's end. I can't stand any more. I've not slept a wink in five nights. The crusade will take us and kill us, or worse. We are doomed. Doomed!~
@46632 = ~Ah, well. One has to ask...~
@46633 = ~Ah, yes. What can I do for you? ~
@46634 = ~Tell me a tale. How did you come to be here?~
@46635 = ~I overheard you discussing alchemy earlier, did I not? Do you have any potions for sale?~
@46636 = ~Let me see what potions you have.~
@46637 = ~I am worried about your friend.~
@46638 = ~You can do nothing for me, for now at least. If that changes, you will know it soon enough.~
@46639 = ~If we let commerce be impeded, the crusade has already won.~
@46640 = ~Of course, of course. Take a look; see what you like.~
@46641 = ~Who, Elandro? I know the man, but calling him a friend is pushing it. He's highly strung and reckless—a terrible combination in anyone dealing with magical energy.~
@46642 = ~He's on edge, and I fear he'll go over it. Can you do anything to calm him down? I fear what he may do, to himself or others.~
@46643 = ~You think he might be dangerous?~
@46644 = ~Does he pose a threat to security? Would we be safer if he were eliminated?~
@46645 = ~Just say the word...~
@46646 = ~Have you met many wizards that aren't?~
@46647 = ~I've tried to convince him to relax and get some sleep, but he is steadfast in his refusal. I'm concerned his amplified fears might attract unwanted attention. Could you talk to him tonight? In the dark his fears may manifest. If they do not, at least we'll know we're safe.~
@46648 = ~Fair enough. I'll just return to my work, then. Good fortune to you.~
@46649 = ~Unstable people frequently are.~
@46650 = ~Stability? Highly overrated, in my experience.~
@46651 = ~Then your experience is limited. Count yourself lucky for it.~
@46652 = ~I wouldn't go so far as to call him a threat. He just needs to relax.~
@46653 = ~If there's nothing else, I really should return to my work. Farewell.~
@46654 = ~I'll tell it if you wish, but it's not much of a story and I'm no bard.~
@46655 = ~Please, I'd like to know.~
@46656 = ~Never mind, then. You have wares to sell?~
@46657 = ~Let's leave it till another time, then. Farewell.~
@46658 = ~Someone wake me when this is over.~ [BD46658]
@46659 = ~And to you.~
@46660 = ~I am an alchemist by trade—well, one of my trades. I am a merchant also, of the potions I make and those of others. Though I fear I make a far better alchemist than I do a merchant.~
@46661 = ~I understand. Please, continue.~
@46662 = ~Good that you see it. Recognizing one's limitations is apparently a skill few possess these days.~
@46663 = ~I am bored already. Don't bother finishing your tale.~
@46664 = ~You can't say I didn't warn you. Well, I'd best get back to my work. Fortune be yours.~
@46665 = ~Really? Gods help me...~ [BD46665]
@46666 = ~Absolutely, though acknowledging one's individual abilities is also an admirable attribute. ~ [BD46666]
@46667 = ~You like yourself a lot, drow. Why?~ [BD46667]
@46668 = ~Oh, muzzle your mouth, you malodorous miscreant.~ [BD46668]
@46669 = ~Er, where was I? Oh, right.~
@46670 = ~Before I arrived here, I was in the village of Soubar, acquiring a collection of useful and highly valuable potions—most were wasted on the crusade, more's the pity. I met Elandro on the road. We traveled together awhile, I intending to eventually go north to Waterdeep, he south to Daggerford.~
@46671 = ~I've been to Daggerford. It was... unpleasant.~
@46672 = ~We were nearly across Boareskyr when the crusade intercepted us, demanding all our possessions. Elandro lost most of his wares; through good fortune and foresight, I held on to most of mine.~

@46674 = ~Thank you for whiling away a few minutes. I appreciate it.~
@46675 = ~You were right—you're no bard.~
@46676 = ~You won't have to wait long now that I'm here.~
@46677 = ~It was my pleasure. If there's nothing else, I really should return to my work. Farewell.~
@46678 = ~I hope you're right. Well, if there's nothing else, I really should get back to my work. Farewell.~
@46679 = ~Eh, what? Oh. Forgive me. I'm just—~
@46680 = ~I'm so—so scared right now. I thought I knew fear. I thought I could handle it, but the crusade and being trapped in here, in this place...~
@46681 = ~There's some who'd covet your place behind these walls. Better that than face the crusade, no?~
@46682 = ~I don't know what to do. I don't know what to do!~
@46683 = ~Do not punish yourself for your fear. Acknowledge it, accept it, learn to live with it. This won't destroy you. It's making you stronger.~
@46684 = ~What you're experiencing is not unusual. Acknowledge your fear. Accept it and learn to live with it. This won't destroy you. It's making you stronger.~
@46685 = ~There's nothing you can do but keep your head down, help those you can, and wait to see how this all plays out.~
@46686 = ~Your forlorn whimpers help nothing. Learn to live with your doubts, or if you can't, at least keep them to yourself.~
@46687 = ~This is worthy advice, applicable in nearly all circumstances.~ [BD46687]
@46688 = ~For children, perhaps. The strong do not wait to see how things play out—they decide what they want, then make it happen.~
@46689 = ~The truly strong use that strength in the service of others.~ [BD46689]
@46690 = ~Tell it to your nursemaid, boy. I'll not listen to such drivel.~
@46691 = ~It would be wiser to fear what is within these walls, rather than beyond them.~ [BD46691]

@46693 = ~Acknowledge, accept, adapt. I can do this. Thank you. Take care.~
@46694 = ~It's not making me stronger! They're going to kill us all! They're going to kill us!~
@46695 = ~That's easy for you to say.~
@46696 = ~It isn't. Nevertheless, it is what you must do if you're to survive.~
@46697 = ~I'm a very skilled orator. That doesn't make it any less true.~
@46698 = ~Don't tell me what's easy. You know nothing of what I've endured.~
@46699 = ~Get back! I'll deal with it.~
@46700 = ~A feyr! The mystical energy enveloping Bridgefort is interacting with the anxiety of its people!~
@46701 = ~It's a problem. Unfortunately, it seems to be my problem...~
@46702 = ~It's nothing good, I can tell you that much.~
@46703 = ~ 'Tis a feyr! Strike it down quickly!~ [BD46703]

@46706 = ~Don't let it kill me! Please, I don't want to die!~
@46707 = ~You are right. I'll—I'll do what I can.~
@46708 = ~You have my thanks. Farewell.~
@46709 = ~We heard sounds of combat! Is everyone all right? What attacked you?~
@46710 = ~Nothing I'd care to fight again, given the choice.~
@46711 = ~A feyr—a coagulation of magic and fear manifesting in the physical realm. Given the amount of magic and distress around the fort, we may see more of them before this is done.~
@46712 = ~We could use some potions of healing, if you've any to spare.~
@46713 = ~What it was is irrelevant. It's dead now.~
@46714 = ~One's one more than I want to see.~ [BD46714]
@46715 = ~The mere fact of the creature's existence is unsettling. But when we work together, there is little that can stand against us.~
@46716 = ~Don't tell me you simians have never seen a feyr before? (Of course they haven't, Edwin. Why would you even ask?)~ [BD46716]
@46717 = ~A fear? What in the Pit is that?~
@46718 = ~A feyr is the inevitable consequence of a surfeit of magical energy combined with the unchecked fear of, say, a fort full of monkeys hiding in their own filth, trying to avoid an overwhelming force that seeks to destroy them. This is only the first. If circumstances don't change, there will be others.~ [BD46718]
@46719 = ~Is there nothing we can do?~
@46720 = ~Nothing but remain calm, especially at night. Feyrs cannot abide sunlight.~
@46721 = ~Nothing but remain calm.~
@46722 = ~Focus on your task.~
@46723 = ~Destroy the monsters as they appear, and hope they don't appear too often.~
@46724 = ~Remain calm? Are you mad? We've crusaders trying to kill us outside the walls, these—these THINGS trying to kill us inside them! And you want us to stay calm?~
@46725 = ~You can be calm or I can soothe your troubled heart permanently. The choice is yours.~
@46726 = ~...I'm calm.~
@46727 = ~How are we supposed to do focus on—on—on anything? Huh? We've crusaders trying to kill us outside the walls, these THINGS trying to kill us inside them! And you want us to focus? How? How? Just tell me that!~
@46728 = ~Easier said than done with things like that floating around.~
@46729 = ~Like all living things, they seek to create the conditions that allow their kind to survive. They instill fear, and that fear sustains them.~ [BD46729]
@46730 = ~They will not feed on Minsc. Fear? I don't know the meaning of the word. Eh? What's that, Boo?~ [BD46730]
@46731 = ~What's that, Boo?~
@46732 = ~Minsc now knows the meaning of the word. But feyrs will not find any in him!~ [BD46732]
@46733 = ~I can spare a couple. The gods know you've earned them.~
@46734 = ~I only have one healing potion. Take it; it's yours.~
@46735 = ~Many thanks.~
@46736 = ~Hand it over.~
@46737 = ~It's we who should be thanking you. Now if you'll excuse me, I'd best return to my post.~
@46738 = ~Excuse me. I'd best return to my post.~
@46739 = ~Thank the gods for that.~
@46740 = ~I doubt telling people not to be afraid will do much, but I'll spread the word nonetheless.~
@46741 = ~I'd be happier if there were some action to take, but the situation is what it is. We will deal with it, as we have everything else. ~

@46747 = ~Says you. YOU haven’t had dogs set on you for sport.~ [BD46747]
@46748 = ~I'm sorry for what happened to you, M'Khiin. But the people who set the dogs on you are to blame to for that, not the dogs themselves.~
@46749 = ~I have, actually. But I don't blame the dogs for that, and I certainly don't blame this one for it. All right, that's enough, boy. I don't have any food for you.~
@46750 = ~I've had worse than that set upon me, goblin. Much worse. Begone, dog. There's nothing here for you.~
@46751 = ~A finer distinction than some care to make when faced with slavering mouths and sharp fangs, <CHARNAME>.~ [BD46751]

@46756 = ~Go! Get out of here, you mangy creature! Begone!~
@46757 = ~Dare! Come here, you silly dog!~
@46758 = ~Forgive him, <PRO_SIRMAAM>. He's a puppy at heart, just trying to be friendly.~
@46759 = ~I'm always happy to see a friendly face, no matter how bad the breath coming out of it.~
@46760 = ~Let me guess—you're the cleric, Tajik, right? I'd heard you were most attached to your dog. I'd like to talk with you about a half-elf named Senderin and her son, if I may.~
@46761 = ~Please! You've nothing to apologize for—well, not to me. M'Khiin here might disagree.~
@46762 = ~Keep the vile beast well away from me in the future.~
@46763 = ~Is this about the horses again? I told them, I can't waste time healing them while the crusade's made targets out of actual people in the fort.~
@46764 = ~I understand. Farewell, Frair Tajik.~
@46765 = ~Perhaps a donation would change your mind? Say, 50 gold?~
@46766 = ~You're a man of faith, but even a man of faith must eat. What if I offered you 100 gold pieces to heal the horses?~
@46767 = ~I don't suppose 200 gold pieces would change your mind?~
@46768 = ~Heal the damned horses or Caelar and her flock will be the least of your worries. Am I making myself understood, here?~
@46769 = ~Sensible. I'll leave you to your business, then.~
@46770 = ~Ah, yes. Yes, you are... quite clear. I'll attend to the matter immediately. Excuse me. Come, Dare! Come on, boy!~
@46771 = ~I've spent weeks fighting the crusade from within this crumbling pile of rocks. Do you really think I fear you? Good day to you. Come, Dare!~
@46772 = ~If that were the case, I would have to seriously reconsider my stance.~
@46773 = ~Here you go. ~
@46774 = ~In better times, it might, but if these were better times, I could just heal the horses. I have a duty to preserve sentient life wherever I can—animals come a distant second, Dare excepted, of course. Now if you'll excuse me—come, Dare!~
@46775 = ~I'll deal with this matter immediately. If you'll excuse me... Come, Dare.~
@46776 = ~Take care. There are crusaders about. Come, Dare!~
@46777 = ~Aye, aye, I'll do that. Come on, Dare! Let's go, boy!~
@46778 = ~Apologize... to the goblin?~
@46779 = ~Is that a problem?~
@46780 = ~You'll be apologizing to me AND the goblin in a minute with that attitude.~
@46781 = ~Are you not sorry? I could make you sorry, if that would help.~
@46782 = ~P-please, Frair. I'd ap-appreciate it.~
@46783 = ~Please forgive the dog, miss—missus? Mister? Miss. Dare wouldn't hurt anyone, not even a gob—ah, I mean, not anyone. Sorry for any trouble he gave you.~
@46784 = ~Come on, Dare. Let's stop bothering the nice <PRO_MANWOMAN> now.~
@46785 = ~Begone, you wretched beast! Go, or I swear I'll turn you into a pair of boots! ~ [BD46785]
@46786 = ~Just admit it, you traitorous pig!~
@46787 = ~Admit it and we'll take it easy on you. Don't, and it'll go very, very hard.~
@46788 = ~I didn't eat any of the food! I didn't, I swear it!~
@46789 = ~Well, someone took that ham. I didn't do it, and Taryl didn't do it. You say you didn't take it? Then who did, eh? Tell me that!~
@46790 = ~What's going on here?~
@46791 = ~You say this man stole your ham? ~
@46792 = ~Believe what you like, do to your friend what you like, I care not—but do it quietly, or by the gods I'll make you wish you had.~
@46793 = ~What's going on here is no concern of yours.~
@46794 = ~They say I took a ham from the storeroom, but I didn't do it!~
@46795 = ~I've got five knuckles that say you did. You calling my fist a liar?~
@46796 = ~Easy, there. What was stolen? Just a ham?~
@46797 = ~I'll call it broken if you don't step back, take a deep breath, and calm down. Now, you say he stole a ham?~
@46798 = ~Explain this nonsense. Quickly. I've little patience for others' idiocy.~
@46799 = ~This flickspittle's been stealing from the fort's supplies. Just little things at first—bags of grain, mostly. But this is too much. He stole a ham! An entire ham! You're a thief, Mattroun! Admit it!~
@46800 = ~There is no "just" a ham when you're stuck in a place that's under siege!~
@46801 = ~He took more than the ham anyway. There's bags of grain gone missing too. He's working for the crusade!~
@46802 = ~He took more than that. There's bags of grain gone missing too. He's working for the crusade!~
@46803 = ~Forgive us, my <PRO_LADYLORD>. We've been stuck inside these crumbling walls for weeks—tension's running high. We'll try to keep it down.~
@46804 = ~I'm not, I swear! I don't know what's going on.~
@46805 = ~Nor do I, but I promise you I will find out. Until then, you two leave this man in peace, am I understood?~
@46806 = ~Seems a simple enough matter to resolve. I'll look into it and see what's really going on here. Until then, try to behave yourselves. Got it?~
@46807 = ~What's going on is you're about to receive a vicious beating from your fellows. Try to cover your head.~
@46808 = ~We'll do as you say. But when you discover this piece of excrement did as we say, we're taking that ham out of your hide, Mattroun!~
@46809 = ~All right, Mattroun! Time to face the music.~
@46810 = ~And my fists! And probably my boots, but first, fists!~
@46811 = ~A poor performance, that. Bridgefort needs all the defenders it can get, yet you leave a man to be beaten, possibly to death, for no good reason.~
@46812 = ~They had a reason, and a good one. He stole from them. It is fitting he be punished for it.~ [BD46812]
@46813 = ~We don't know what he did. We could have at least looked into the matter.~
@46814 = ~We waste enough time on baboons as it is. Let them sort it out amongst themselves, I say.~
@46815 = ~Hm? Oh, it's you. So, you figure out who's been stealing supplies yet?~
@46816 = ~Alas, no. But I continue to look into the matter.~
@46817 = ~Working on it. ~
@46818 = ~Not yet. Tell me why you believe your friend took the food.~
@46819 = ~I wanted to talk to you about that, actually. When did the food start going missing?~
@46820 = ~I know who's doing it. You are.~
@46821 = ~Mattroun? That swine's no friend of mine.~
@46822 = ~What?~
@46823 = ~A joke. Unless you did steal the food. Did you?~
@46824 = ~Did I say you did it? Forgive me. The stress of being in this godsforsaken place must be getting to me. Why do you believe Mattroun is the thief?~
@46825 = ~You stole the ham and the grain. At least, that's what I'll tell your friend if you don't give me 200 gold pieces to prove your innocence.~
@46826 = ~200 gold—? I don't have that much! I've got... here, I have 35 gold and three potions. Will that be enough for you?~
@46827 = ~It will suffice. Hand them over.~
@46828 = ~Perhaps. Giving them to me won't hurt your case, at any rate.~
@46829 = ~Hope you choke on them, fiend. You're worse than Mattroun.~
@46830 = ~Well, let me know when you find out. I want to be there to pay the dog back.~
@46831 = ~Don't know. We didn't notice it till this morning. Then we did a count and realized we were shorter on grain that we ought to be. But it's the ham that really hurts. I'd kill for some ham right now...~
@46832 = ~If you want ham, you should slaughter a pig, not your fellow defender of the fort.~
@46833 = ~Yeah, I picked up on that. What makes you think Mattroun is the culprit?~
@46834 = ~I'm done with you.~
@46835 = ~We don't have a lot of people for security in the fort itself—even us who watch the storage room do our time on the walls, making sure the crusaders don't get in.~
@46836 = ~There're four—well, three, now—people who watch the store room. Me, Taryl, and that pig Mattroun. Kellard took an arrow yesterday, so we lost him.~
@46837 = ~I am sorry for your loss.~
@46838 = ~It happens.~
@46839 = ~I don't want to hear about who didn't take the food. I want to know who did.~
@46840 = ~Enough. I weary of this conversation.~
@46841 = ~We know the ham was taken while Mattroun was minding the store. He says he fell asleep and someone snuck by him. But Jegg Hillcarver's forge is right around the corner from there. She says nobody went in or out of the area while Mattroun was there.~
@46842 = ~Mattroun is a pig. And if it comes down to it, I'll roast and eat him like one. I'm THAT hungry.~
@46843 = ~Yeah. Me too. Anyway...~
@46844 = ~It shouldn't happen to a man like Kellard. But it's done, and there's naught to be done about it. As to Mattroun...~
@46845 = ~No! I didn't steal that ham, or the wheat, or any other gods damned thing in the storeroom. Listen...~
@46846 = ~Look, Mattroun took the ham, that's all there is to it. When you figure that out, you let me know. Until then, keep your distance.~
@46847 = ~Well met. And how are you finding our little fort?~
@46848 = ~It's in better shape than I'd have expected, given the crusade's actions.~
@46849 = ~Better than some. There's a half-elf named Senderin out back who's beside herself with worry over the state of her horses.~
@46850 = ~I've spent time in worse places. But not many.~
@46851 = ~Disappointing. It cannot withstand the crusade much longer.~
@46852 = ~Indefensible, in every sense of the word.~
@46853 = ~I fear you are right—but I hope you are wrong. If there is anything I can help you with, please let me know.~
@46854 = ~We have Khalid to thank for that. Without him, we would have fallen long ago. If there's anything I can help you with, please do let me know.~
@46855 = ~If there's anything I can help you with, please let me know.~
@46856 = ~These are hard times. We do the best we can, under the circumstances. Well, I'd best return to my duties. If there's anything I can help you with, please let me know.~
@46857 = ~That is unfortunate, but I told Senderin—and her son Merome, SEVERAL times—it would be irresponsible to expend resources healing horses while actual people are at risk.~
@46858 = ~I understand. Farewell, Frair Tajik.~
@46859 = ~Perhaps a donation to the church would change your mind? Say, 50 gold?~
@46860 = ~You're a man of faith, but even a man of faith must eat. What if I offered you 100 gold pieces to heal the horses?~
@46861 = ~I don't suppose 200 gold pieces would change your mind?~
@46862 = ~You can heal the damned horses or you can heal yourself, it's your choice to make. Am I making myself understood, here?~
@46863 = ~That makes sense, but it seems few in these parts value the sensible much. I'll leave you to your business, then.~
@46864 = ~So are we good to pound that barnacle on Bridgefort's arse Mattroun into a bloody pulp? ~
@46865 = ~I've yet to determine whether he stole the ham.~
@46866 = ~Not yet, no.~
@46867 = ~When we are, I'll let you know.~
@46868 = ~What makes you so certain Mattroun is the thief?~
@46869 = ~You're the one who'll be pulped if you don't give me what I want.~
@46870 = ~Good. You do that.~
@46871 = ~Why're you talking to me, then?~
@46872 = ~I would know why you believe him guilty of the crime.~
@46873 = ~I really don't know.~
@46874 = ~I am in need of gold. I thought you might give me some. 200 pieces, to be precise. In exchange, I'll not accuse you of stealing from the supply room.~
@46875 = ~Be on your way, then.~
@46876 = ~I believe it because he did it, that's why I believe it. Nobody else could've. Jegg would've seen them!~
@46877 = ~I'll have to speak to mistress Hillcarver about this.~
@46878 = ~Jegg?~
@46879 = ~I'll look into that.~
@46880 = ~Interesting. I'll leave you to your prayers now.~
@46881 = ~Our smith. She was at her forge the whole time, just a few feet from Mattroun. She saw him snoozing when he was supposed to be on watch.~
@46882 = ~You know what she didn't see? She didn't see anyone else go into the store room. But when Kellard took over, the ham was gone.~
@46883 = ~You make a compelling case against Mattroun. I'll consider the matter.~
@46884 = ~I'd like to speak to this Kellard.~
@46885 = ~Most helpful. I will leave you to your prayers now.~
@46886 = ~I hope you're a god, then—you're not likely to get a chance otherwise. A crusade arrow got him.~
@46887 = ~I'm sorry for your loss.~
@46888 = ~That's unfortunate.~
@46889 = ~I see. Very well. I'll leave you to your meditations.~
@46890 = ~You do that. She was at her forge the whole time, just a few feet from Mattroun. She heard saw him dozing when he was supposed to be standing guard.~
@46891 = ~Well, come get me when you are. Good <DAYNIGHTALL>.~
@46892 = ~It'll be a better one when Mattroun gets what's coming to him.~
@46893 = ~What are you on about now...?~
@46894 = ~Nothing of any great import. Tell me, why do you believe Mattroun stole the ham?~
@46895 = ~Give me 200 gold and I'll not accuse you of the theft.~
@46896 = ~So that's how you want to do this, eh? I can play that game. I was a woman of means when the 'fort was open. Here. That's not just for me, mind. I want that lousy filcher Mattroun on a meathook. Come let me know when I can put him down.~
@46897 = ~You threaten me? I'll hang you from a meathook, you rotten swindler! ~
@46898 = ~That's not just for me, mind you. I want that lousy filcher Mattroun on a meathook, you understand? Get out of here now. Come let me know when I can put him down.~
@46899 = ~Mattroun's going to be sorrier for his. Come and get me when I'm allowed to twist his fat, thieving fingers off.~
@46900 = ~More unfortunate for some than for others. Let me know when I'm allowed to kick Mattroun's teeth down his stinking throat. You'll find me either here or on the wall.~
@46901 = ~Ho there. You have my thanks for saving me from Taryl and Harth, for the moment, at least. My name is Mattroun.~
@46902 = ~Pleased to meet you, Mattroun. I am <CHARNAME>.~
@46903 = ~You're the one they think stole the ham, yes? My name is <CHARNAME>.~
@46904 = ~I could save you from them for longer, if you gave me, say, 200 gold pieces...~
@46905 = ~Oh, I know who you are. Bridgefort's a small place. Word travels fast. Faster than the truth. Taryl and Harth have half my friends believing I stole from them. ~
@46906 = ~If it be not true, you can count on me to defend you.~
@46907 = ~Don't worry about Taryl and Harth. I'll take care of your accusers.~
@46908 = ~I can help you with that—for a price. Give me 200 gold and I'll lay the blame elsewhere.~
@46909 = ~It's NOT true, I swear it! I've risked my life to defend Bridgefort, I'd never do anything to harm a single one of these people. I was just...~
@46910 = ~What? I—I don't have that kind of money. I don't have any money!~
@46911 = ~Of all the luck... Well, I had to try. All right, tell me how you came to be accused in this matter.~
@46912 = ~Can you GET that kind of money?~
@46913 = ~That is unfortunate—for you. Good <DAYNIGHTALL>.~
@46914 = ~Then I guess we're done talking.~
@46915 = ~What? I—I don't have that kind of money. I don't have any money! Please, please, my <PRO_LADYLORD>, don't do this! They'll kill me! I didn't take anything.~
@46916 = ~Of all the luck... Well, I had to try. All right, tell me how you came to be accused in this matter.~
@46917 = ~All right, calm down. Tell me a tale. How did you come to find yourself in this unenviable position?~
@46918 = ~You should have. That way you'd have something with which to bargain. Farewell, Mattroun—as well as you can.~
@46919 = ~Have mercy on me, I beg you. I don't want to die. I don't want to die...~
@46920 = ~No. No! I'll not let you do this to me! On your guard, fiend!~
@46921 = ~Take care of them...? What do you mean to do? Harth and Taryl aren't evil—well, Harth isn't. I don't want them hurt, I just want them to, you know, not hurt me, either.~
@46922 = ~Though they accuse you of a grievous crime, you show them compassion. Alas, I doubt they'd do the same for you. Tell me then, do you know anyone else who might have done this deed?~
@46923 = ~Well, someone has to pay for the bloody crime, else everyone will think they can get away with robbing their fellows.~
@46924 = ~You would have me spare your accusers? Pathetic. I'm done with you.~
@46925 = ~I was so tired after my shift on the wall—so tired. I was to watch the supply room, and I did, for a time—but I couldn't keep my eyes open. I fell asleep. When I awoke, there was a trail of grain leading from the room. I checked, and a ham was missing.~
@46926 = ~Jegg Hillcarver, the little... blacksmith, was at her forge the whole time 'round the corner the whole time. She says I was the only one to go near the room the entire time, but I didn't do it, I swear, it wasn't me!~
@46927 = ~I see. Can you think of someone who might be wiling to rob the supply room?~
@46928 = ~I'm going to look into this for you. While I do, you'd do well to stay low. Don't draw attention to yourself, don't get anyone else angry at you.~
@46929 = ~Silence! You're pathetic, man! I should let you take the blame for the theft just to still those blubbering lips!~
@46930 = ~There's a man named Roark. I don't like the way he looks at us sometimes. But if he did do it, Jegg would surely have seen him pass. Though she's made me a suspect, I can't see her lying, for any reason.~
@46931 = ~We have a mystery then. One I shall endeavor to solve. Until then, keep to yourself and try and stay out of trouble.~
@46932 = ~I've seen this Roark. A crusade sling-wielder creased his skull. He lives, through blind luck or gods' grace, I know not which.~
@46933 = ~If I see this Roark, I'll talk to him. Until then, keep to yourself, you understand?~
@46934 = ~I see. Very well. I'll be about my business, then.~
@46935 = ~I'll do that. Thank you, my <PRO_LADYLORD>.~
@46936 = ~As I said, his face—his eyes—sometimes disturb me, but that is an unfounded prejudice. I am glad he survived.~
@46937 = ~I'm going to get to the bottom of this matter, Mattroun. Until I do, keep to yourself, eh? Try and stay out of trouble.~
@46938 = ~As he is, I'm sure. Look, I'm going to try and find out what's going on with the theft, but in the meantime, you need to be careful. Be quiet. Don't attract attention to yourself. Got it?~
@46939 = ~It might have served you better if he hadn't—you could have accused him of the crime and been done with it. I'll leave you to your business—for the moment.~
@46940 = ~Take care of yourself, <PRO_SIRMAAM>. There's crusaders about. ~
@46941 = ~Who're you? ~
@46942 = ~The name's <CHARNAME>. I am also called the champion of Baldur's Gate. I'm here to help.~
@46943 = ~I am called <CHARNAME>. And you are?~
@46944 = ~No one of consequence. Be seeing you.~
@46945 = ~Glad to hear it—we need all the help we can get. What can I do for you? ~
@46946 = ~Who are you?~
@46947 = ~I'm looking into the matter of some stolen food.~
@46948 = ~I would know your thoughts on the crimes Mattroun is accused of.~
@46949 = ~For now? Nothing.~
@46950 = ~The ham Mattroun stole? ~
@46951 = ~The ham Mattroun might have stolen.~
@46952 = ~You believe he did it, then?~
@46953 = ~Has any other food been stolen recently?~
@46954 = ~I can scarce believe it myself. But Jegg wouldn't lie and Mattroun didn't do himself any favors with his explanation. ~
@46955 = ~Tell me the story as it was told to you. I assume it was told to you, you didn't see it yourself?~
@46956 = ~What was his explanation?~
@46957 = ~I see. Thank you for the information. Farewell.~
@46958 = ~Terrible, is what it was. He says he fell asleep, which is easy enough to believe, I've nodded off once or twice myself. When he woke up, the feedbags were torn open and the ham was gone. Jegg was right over there the whole time, she didn't see anyone come by. He admits she would've seen anyone else, but insists he didn't do it. It's a, what's it called—? A quandary, that's what it is.~
@46959 = ~Luck to you.~
@46960 = ~I saw some of the spilled grain on the floor. When I heard about the ham, I could've wept. I don't know who did it, in truth, but they've much to answer for.~
@46961 = ~They will. I assure you. May I look around?~
@46962 = ~They will pay a high price indeed for the crimes they've committed.~
@46963 = ~We are of one mind on that. Farewell.~
@46964 = ~Of course. Just don't take anything, yeah? ~
@46965 = ~I'll leave the door open.~
@46966 = ~You can trust me.~
@46967 = ~With your eagle eye upon me? I wouldn't dare try.~
@46968 = ~I trusted Mattroun, and that didn't turn out so well. You need anything else, you let me know.~
@46969 = ~Not much choice there—it doesn't lock. Bridgefort wasn't made with thieves in mind, y'know? If there's anything you need, let me know.~
@46970 = ~Wessel. Pleased to make your acquaintance.~
@46971 = ~All right, all right. I had to say it. You don't need to lay it on THAT thick.~
@46972 = ~Not long, not long at all. Kellard—the woman who had this shift 'fore me—she just died yesterday. Bloody crusade.~
@46973 = ~Anything I can do for you...?~
@46974 = ~That should do it. Thank you.~
@46975 = ~I'm looking into the matter of some stolen food.~
@46976 = ~I would know your thoughts on the crimes Mattroun is accused of.~
@46977 = ~For now? Nothing.~
@46978 = ~I don't know how you got here, but watch your back, all right? This is a dangerous place to be right now. Farewell. ~
@46979 = ~A dog did this. Foul beasts, all of them.~ [BD46979]
@46980 = ~We know who our thief is now, or at least who he isn't. It was a dog's teeth that picked this bone clean.~
@46981 = ~Boo says no man stole this bone. A hungry dog did this. Hungry before it got the ham. Afterward? Not so much.~ [BD46981]
@46982 = ~Ah! Get it away from me! Away!~ [BD46982]
@46983 = ~Dare! Leave her alone! Come here!~
@46984 = ~How goes the search for the thief? ~
@46985 = ~I believe I know who stole the ham.~
@46986 = ~You heard about that, did you?~
@46987 = ~It's nearing its end, thank the gods.~
@46988 = ~You'll find out shortly.~
@46989 = ~The fort's not so big. Word travels fast. ~
@46990 = ~I know who stole the ham.~
@46991 = ~Mattroun has found that out firsthand.~
@46992 = ~Then you'll hear of my results soon enough.~
@46993 = ~I see. What—what are you going to do? ~
@46994 = ~It's all right, Frair. I've a fondness for animals myself. I won't let anything happen to Dare.~
@46995 = ~That depends. Dare isn't the only animal suffering in Bridgefort. The half-elf Senderin's horses are near death. She and her son have lost much already, I'd hate for them to lose more. Wouldn't you?~
@46996 = ~A man's life hangs in the balance here. What would you have me do?~
@46997 = ~That depends on how much you're willing to pay for your friend's life.~
@46998 = ~Senderin and Merome do NOT see their horses as I do Dare. But I'll do anything to save my dog—anything. I'll go tend to the horses immediately.~
@46999 = ~Dare is like a child to me. I'll give you everything I have; please, don't turn him over to Taryl or the others—they'll rip him apart!~
@47000 = ~They'll do no such thing. The dog meant no harm, he simply did what came naturally. Get him on a leash, though—we don't want a repeat of this situation.~
@47001 = ~I understand. But the fort's defenders need provisions more than your dog does. You've compromised morale and taken food from your fellows' mouths.~
@47002 = ~And eat her, in all likelihood. All right. Give me all the gold you've got—everything of value—and I'll not reveal what I know.~
@47003 = ~You're a good <PRO_MANWOMAN>, my <PRO_LADYLORD>. Thank you, thank you for sparing my little girl. ~
@47004 = ~There's been enough suffering in this place of late. I'll not add to yours.~
@47005 = ~A pleasure doing business with you.~
@47006 = ~Cease your gibbering. Your gold's all the thanks I need.~
@47007 = ~Bless you, my <PRO_LADYLORD>. You've done a good and noble thing. Lathander will smile upon you, I'm sure of it. Thank you, bless you!~
@47008 = ~That is unfortunate.~
@47009 = ~You realize I can't let him continue to take the blame for the theft, don't you?~
@47010 = ~It could be very unfortunate. Taryl and Harth want to kill him. If I let them, I'll be complicit in murder. Would you truly let that happen?~
@47011 = ~It will be more unfortunate still for the true culprit.~
@47012 = ~Oh. Good... That's good...? ~
@47013 = ~You figure out who's been stealing supplies yet? ~
@47014 = ~I have. Bring Taryl and Mattroun in here and all will be revealed.~
@47015 = ~Alas, no. I continue to look into it.~
@47016 = ~Working on it. ~
@47017 = ~Not yet. Tell me why you believe Mattroun took the food.~
@47018 = ~Aye. I'll do that.~
@47019 = ~Taryl's dead.~
@47020 = ~I'm sorry to hear it. Well, it won't have the same drama, but fetch Mattroun and let's see this done.~
@47021 = ~Good riddance to bad rubbish. Get Mattroun then, and meet me over by the shrine.~
@47022 = ~Mattroun... isn't with us anymore. ~
@47023 = ~Did Taryl kill him?~
@47024 = ~Ah. Right. Well, get Taryl anyway and bring her to me near the entrance to the shrine.~
@47025 = ~They're dead. ~
@47026 = ~Both of them? That's... unfortunate.~
@47027 = ~Oh. Right. Never mind, then.~
@47028 = ~Then I've wasted time and effort on this fool's errand.~
@47029 = ~You know how he died. ~
@47030 = ~Ah. Yes. Very well. Get Taryl, then, and meet me by the shrine's entrance.~
@47031 = ~If you insist. Though Mattroun is dead, we should still see this to an end. Fetch Taryl. Bring her to me near the entrance to the shrine.~
@47032 = ~I don't know how he died. ~
@47033 = ~Ah. Yes. Very well. Get her, then, and meet me by the entry to the shrine.~
@47034 = ~If you insist. Though Mattroun is dead, we should still see this to an end. Fetch Taryl. Bring her to me near the shrine's entrance.~
@47035 = ~You've my thanks for the effort, but it was Taryl who really cared about this mess. Without her, there's not much reason to pursue the matter that I can see. Fare thee well.~
@47036 = ~Seems to me you did well enough out of this. They're dead and you line your pockets. I'm done with you. Fare thee well, "hero."~
@47037 = ~So are we good to pound a lousy no-good pilferer into a bloody pulp? ~
@47038 = ~Get Harth and Mattroun and meet me outside the shrine. All will be revealed.~
@47039 = ~I'll tell you after you've assembled the others in the hall outside. If worst comes to worst, I'd not see a shrine of Lathander desecrated by violence.~
@47040 = ~Not yet, no.~
@47041 = ~When we are, I'll let you know.~
@47042 = ~What makes you so certain Mattroun is the thief?~
@47043 = ~You'll be the one pulped if I don't get what I want.~
@47044 = ~Something's gonna be desecrated by violence, I can tell you that much.~
@47045 = ~Harth's dead. But I'll get that vile poltroon Mattroun for you, sure enough.~
@47046 = ~Was it Mattroun who did it? If it was, forget all this. He's dead.~
@47047 = ~Mattroun was the criminal, yes.~
@47048 = ~It wasn't Mattroun.~
@47049 = ~Don't waste your time. It's over. Mattroun is dead, so's Harth. A missing ham... doesn't seem so big a thing right now. Farewell.~
@47050 = ~As you wish.~
@47051 = ~Well, now you've got me interested. I'll fetch Harth.~
@47052 = ~I knew it! I BLOODY WELL KNEW IT! Bloody Mattroun. He's lucky he's dead, you know that? He's LUCKY.~
@47053 = ~How goes the investigation? ~
@47054 = ~I'm ready to expose the culprit. Gather the others and meet me inside the keep, outside the shrine.~
@47055 = ~Relax. I've got it all figured out. Get Harth and Taryl and meet me in the hall outside the shrine.~
@47056 = ~Nervous? I would be. Bring the others to the main hall.~
@47057 = ~If I must. Best to have this done quickly.~
@47058 = ~Do we really need to do this? Taryl's dead. Harth doesn't care that much without her egging him on.~
@47059 = ~Get him anyway. Best we clear your name.~
@47060 = ~You're right. Very well. We'll call this done, then.~
@47061 = ~I like the sound of that.~
@47062 = ~Harth's dead. I'll get Taryl, but you've gotta stay between us. She wanted to kill me before, who knows what sort of mood she's in now?~
@47063 = ~There's no one else to get. Harth and Taryl are dead.~
@47064 = ~I'm sorry to hear that.~
@47065 = ~This war. This damned, dirty war. How many more lives will it claim? HOW MANY?!~
@47066 = ~It happens.~
@47067 = ~I'd be sorrier if they hadn't been hells-bent on killing me for something I didn't do. Luck to you, <CHARNAME>.~
@47068 = ~I like the sound of that.~
@47069 = ~It wasn't a war that killed them. It was you.~
@47070 = ~Oh. Right. Well, good <DAYNIGHTALL> to you then.~
@47071 = ~I solved your problem. I think that merits a reward of some sort, don't you?~
@47072 = ~A better one than it could've been with Harth and especially Taryl alive. This wasn't how I wanted things to end, but you have my thanks. Farewell.~
@47073 = ~...Fine. Here's what I have. It's all I've got. You want to kill me for what I don't have, you go right ahead.~
@47074 = ~What's going on...?~
@47075 = ~The hero of Baldur's Gate's gonna tell us who stole the ham. Then I'm gonna kick their thieving arse round the courtyard.~
@47076 = ~I tell you, I didn't steal the ham! I didn't steal ANY food!~
@47077 = ~We'll see about that.~
@47078 = ~What have you learned, <CHARNAME>?~
@47079 = ~Mattroun did it. He took the ham.~
@47080 = ~Enough to determine who your thief is.~
@47081 = ~The thief is dead. Let us leave it at that.~
@47082 = ~Forgive me, Frair. I have to tell them the truth.~
@47083 = ~It was Frair Tajik's dog that took the ham.~
@47084 = ~Nothing. I don't know who stole the ham. I wish I did, but I don't.~
@47085 = ~What? All that and this is what you give us? "Hero of Baldur's Gate," my pockmarked behind! Worthless, that's what you are. Worthless!~
@47086 = ~I'd hoped for better than this, <CHARNAME>. If Taryl kills me, it's on your head.~
@47087 = ~A weak effort, <CHARNAME>. I can't say I expected better at this point, but I had hoped for it. Farewell.~
@47088 = ~No, let's not do that! "Hero of Baldur's Gate," my pockmarked behind! Worthless, that's what you are. Worthless!~
@47089 = ~Well, at the least you saw my innocence. I thank you for that.~
@47090 = ~Let's hear the verdict, then.~
@47091 = ~The man who took the ham is dead. Let us leave it at that.~
@47092 = ~Forgive me, Frair. I have to tell them the truth.~
@47093 = ~It was Frair Tajik's dog that took the ham.~
@47094 = ~I wish I had one. The thief's identity remains a mystery.~
@47095 = ~I'm surprised you're so eager for my judgment, Mattroun—seeing as you stole the ham.~
@47096 = ~What? All that and this is what you give us? "Hero of Baldur's Gate," my pockmarked behind! Worthless, that's what you are. Worthless!~
@47097 = ~I'd hoped for better than this, <CHARNAME>. If Taryl kills me, it's on your head.~
@47098 = ~Liar! You dirty liar, I'll have your head!~
@47099 = ~I'll have yours first, you rank bastard!~
@47100 = ~Frair...? What's <PRO_HESHE> on about?~
@47101 = ~Don't do this, <CHARNAME>. I beg you, please...~
@47102 = ~The truth is... I found a rat hole behind the store room shelves, and in it, a hambone picked clean of meat.~
@47103 = ~Mattroun's crime is nothing more than falling asleep. As to who took the ham, well that was Frair's dog.~
@47104 = ~Er... The thief is dead. Let's just let sleeping dogs lie.~
@47105 = ~ 'Twas Frair's ragged hound that raided the larder.~
@47106 = ~Rats...? That makes a kind of sense.~
@47107 = ~Rats! Yes! That explains everything!~
@47108 = ~Huh. Guess I owe someone an apology.~
@47109 = ~I gratefully accept your apology.~
@47110 = ~I didn't say I was sorry, just that I owed you an apology. You didn't take the ham, but I still want to kill you. It'll pass. Just give me some time.~
@47111 = ~Thank you, <CHARNAME>. Thank you for your efforts, your service in resolving this. Everyone in Bridgefort is in your debt.~
@47112 = ~It was my sincere pleasure, Frair. I'm glad to have helped.~
@47113 = ~Big rats they were too. Huge buggers.~
@47114 = ~Some more than others. By the way, didn't I hear you say you were going to go heal a couple of horses?~
@47115 = ~Let us retire to the shrine to discuss how that debt might best be repaid.~
@47116 = ~Yes. They are.~
@47117 = ~Er, yes. Yes, you did. I'll be taking care of that shortly.~
@47118 = ~Yes, yes, let's not overdo it...~
@47119 = ~I'm gonna kill that flea-bitten mongrel. I'M GONNA KILL IT!~
@47120 = ~Please, don't hurt my dog! Please!~
@47121 = ~Nobody will hurt the dog. He did what came naturally. I've spoken to Frair. He'll keep it leashed from now on.~
@47122 = ~It's just a dog. Killing it will give no one satisfaction.~
@47123 = ~I'll slay the mangy beast myself.~
@47124 = ~The loss is still on your head, Mattroun. If you hadn't fallen asleep... Eh. What's done is done.~
@47125 = ~On my honor, on Lathander himself, I swear to you, Dare will never eat anything I don't personally hand him ever again. Thank you, <CHARNAME>. Thank you for your wisdom and your kindness.~
@47126 = ~Good.~ [BD47126]
@47127 = ~You're too late. You're too late! I sent him away, across the moat. He's free and safe from you—you barbarians! Savages!~
@47128 = ~You shouldn't've done that, priest.~
@47129 = ~I regret nothing! Slay me if you must, but Dare will live, my child will live! That's all that matters. The only thing.~
@47130 = ~Thank you for resolving this, <CHARNAME>. I've little to offer you right now. Return in a day's time. I'll cobbled together something suitable to reward your effort. Until then, farewell.~
@47131 = ~That mangy sack of fleas! I'll kill it. I'M GONNA KILL IT!~
@47132 = ~The dog—of course. It all makes sense.~
@47133 = ~I'll not kill a dumb animal over this—certainly not a dumb animal that's proven itself happy to use its fangs on crusaders.~
@47134 = ~I knew it! I KNEW IT!~
@47135 = ~It's good to know, I suppose, though it matters little enough now. My thanks for resolving this, <CHARNAME>. I've little to offer you right now. Return in a day's time. I'll cobbled together something suitable to reward your effort. Until then, farewell.~
@47136 = ~Indeed.~
@47137 = ~I owe you a great debt, <CHARNAME>. You saved my child.~
@47138 = ~You owe me nothing, Frair. Regardless of what they do—regardless of what we must sometimes do to them—animals are true innocents. They don't comprehend good and evil. I'd sooner say I stole the ham than Dare.~
@47139 = ~You owe me nothing. Even if you did, I doubt you're in much of a position to pay the debt. Just keep an eye on your dog, all right?~
@47140 = ~I would speak to you regarding the half-elf Senderin. She's in the northeast corner of the courtyard—you know her?~
@47141 = ~You are right, on both counts. What have you got for me?~
@47142 = ~I don't know what you're talking about, and it would better for all if you ceased talking of it at all. Understood?~
@47143 = ~Feh. An innocent's teeth and claws rip the flesh as readily as any evildoer's.~ [BD47143]
@47144 = ~A close eye. When the stores run low, they may turn to... alternative food sources.~ [BD47144]
@47145 = ~This is beneath us, <CHARNAME>. Or it should be, at least.~
@47146 = ~Subtle, <CHARNAME>. Very subtle.~ [BD47146]
@47147 = ~For my part, I'll see that Dare is leashed, or at the very least not let him run free without watching him carefully. This situation will not repeat itself.~
@47148 = ~I can ask no better. Good <DAYNIGHTALL>, Frair.~
@47149 = ~What situation is that? I'm sorry, my friend, but I haven't the foggiest notion what you're talking about.~
@47150 = ~See that it doesn't. I'll not look a fool on that fleabitten cur's behalf. Luck to you.~
@47151 = ~Please, accept a small token of thanks.~
@47152 = ~Keep it, my friend. If you truly don't need it, then sell it if you can. Use the money to feed Dare.~
@47153 = ~I'm a decent enough person, but I'm no saint. I'll not say no to such an offer.~
@47154 = ~And I would like to accept that small token. Or any larger tokens you may have.~
@47155 = ~Hand it over.~
@47156 = ~You are too kind, <CHARNAME>. By far.~
@47157 = ~Your generosity is beyond reproach. I'll not soon forget this, <CHARNAME>. If there's anything you ever need, please let me know. I'll do everything in my power to provide it. Until then, farewell.~
@47158 = ~We're done here, then? Good. Let's go.~
@47159 = ~And to you, my friend.~
@47160 = ~Here, take it, take it all. Dare is all that matters.~
@47161 = ~When you put it like that, I cannot bring myself to accept this. Use it to care for the dog.~
@47162 = ~A pleasure doing business. Luck to you, Frair.~
@47163 = ~The cur matters little to me. Your gold is another matter altogether.~
@47164 = ~It is a good thing you do, <CHARNAME>. Boo approves.~ [BD47164]
@47165 = ~I will. You do the same.~
@47166 = ~If I had more to give you, I would, without hesitation. But you have everything that was once mine—all but that which matters most. So I thank you, in spite of everything. Thank you. Farewell.~
@47167 = ~Ah, yes, I understand you perfectly. So I'll say this and nothing more: If there's anything you ever need, please let me know. I'll do everything in my power to provide it. Until then, farewell.~
@47168 = ~Is this about the horses again? I told them, I can't waste use energy healing them when I might be called upon to help actual people at any moment.~
@47169 = ~Dare is an animal—an adorable one, but an animal nonetheless. Yet you care deeply about him. Senderin and her son care deeply about their horses. Those horses will die without your help.~
@47170 = ~Perhaps a donation to the church would change your mind? Say, 50 gold?~
@47171 = ~You're a man of faith, but even a man of faith must eat. What if I offered you 100 gold pieces to heal the horses?~
@47172 = ~I don't suppose 200 gold pieces would change your mind?~
@47173 = ~Sensible. I'll leave you to your business, then.~
@47174 = ~I'll take the gold, as there's always a use for it. You saved Dare, so I will do the same for Senderin's nags, though I assure you her feelings for them are nothing like mine for Dare. Come on, boy! Let's go heal some horses.~
@47175 = ~Here you go. ~
@47176 = ~That changes nothing, I'm afraid. I have a duty to preserve life wherever I can—sentient life first, animals a distant second. Dare excepted, of course. Now if you'll excuse me— Come, Dare!~
@47177 = ~If you'll excuse me, I'll go deal with this matter immediately.~
@47178 = ~Take care. There are crusaders about. Come, Dare!~
@47179 = ~What Senderin and that wretched child of hers feel for their horses cannot compare to my love for Dare. But as you saved his life. I'll not refuse you this. Come, Dare! We've nags to minister to.~
@47180 = ~You cost me my child. I've nothing to say to you. ~
@47181 = ~I did what I had to do, Frair. An innocent man was wrongly accused.~
@47182 = ~I've done you a favor. You invest too much in that animal.~

@47184 = ~A dead man. It would have cost neither him nor you anything to let his accusers believe in his guilt. I don't want to look at you. Begone!~
@47185 = ~I don't want to talk to you. Begone!~
@47186 = ~Hey! Boo is right here, you know...~ [BD47186]
@47187 = ~There are few things worse than a man who thinks his pet is a person. Wait. Boo says that's not right.~ [BD47187]
@47188 = ~Well met. I've collected what I could as thanks for your help with the ham theft. It's not much, but it's the best I could manage.~
@47189 = ~Keep it, my friend. We're all in this together.~
@47190 = ~Not much is still something. I'll take it.~
@47191 = ~It will have to suffice.~
@47192 = ~We must put aside our personal goals to work together for the common good.~ [BD47192]
@47193 = ~Gods, monk! Is there any hollow platitude you won't offer up as solemn wisdom?~ [BD47193]
@47194 = ~Do not hold the fool's desperate clutching for significance against him, Safana. He is as his goddess has made him.~ [BD47194]
@47195 = ~Selûne has blessed me with many gifts, Sharran. You are fortunate patience is among them.~ [BD47195]
@47196 = ~Not taking the reward's a noble gesture, <CHARNAME>. Would've been nice if you'd made it before I went to the effort of collecting it, but... Eh. Take care. There are crusaders about.~
@47197 = ~He's right. There are crusaders about, and we should really be doing something about them, don't you think?~
@47198 = ~Taking scraps from those who have little enough already, <CHARNAME>? I suppose I shouldn't be surprised.~
@47199 = ~We do what we can. Good work deserves recognition. If there's anything else you need from me, I'll be around. Luck to you, and take care. There are crusaders about.~
@47200 = ~Yeah. It will.~
@47201 = ~Ja, ja, this is the place. The elf—the half-elf lass's seven-legged spider is here.~ [BD47201]
@47202 = ~All right! LET'S DO THIS!~
@47203 = ~Don't like this place. All the moaning. Ugh.~ [BD47203]
@47204 = ~Thou art the only one moaning here, little goblin.~ [BD47204]
@47205 = ~You can't hear the dead? Lucky.~ [BD47205]
@47206 = ~Boo doesn't like this place... He had a bad experience with a web once. He does not want to talk about it.~ [BD47206]
@47207 = ~Webs. No matter how far I go, they are there to snare me. I despise them. ~ [BD47207]
@47208 = ~I like you, <CHARNAME>. You always visit such interesting places. ~ [BD47208]
@47209 = ~I think we have more important things to do than this. Don't you? ~
@47210 = ~This is foolish. The gods know what Caelar's doing while we waste our time here. ~
@47211 = ~What idiocy have you simians gotten me mixed up in now? (Why do I ask? They know nothing, at least nothing of value...) ~
@47212 = ~That sound... That is no spider. ~ [BD47212]
@47213 = ~Anyone else think it's about time we got the hells out of here? ~
@47214 = ~Now that is a beetle. ~ [BD47214]
@47215 = ~A rhino beetle. It is here to feed on the spiders' eggs. It would be best for us if we let it. ~
@47216 = ~Bugs only care about eating. Grab some spider eggs. They'll draw the big one away from the hole.~ [BD47216]
@47217 = ~Best attend the boisterous little beast. Beating blockades is very much her bailiwick.~ [BD47217]
@47218 = ~Nicely done. ~
@47219 = ~That was time well-spent. ~ [BD47219]
@47220 = ~We got a decent shield out of it.~
@47221 = ~I've spent time in worse ways.~
@47222 = ~Better spent that way than dying.~
@47223 = ~I suppose that's true enough. Let's go. ~
@47224 = ~Let's.~
@47225 = ~In a moment, I want to look around a little more.~

@47234 = ~Well, I'm thoroughly disgusted. You? ~ [BD47234]
@47235 = ~I'll still take beetles over spiders. ~ [BD47235]
@47236 = ~Even the mighty rhinoceros beetle cannot prevail against the might of Thayan magick. (You were a fool to try, bug.) ~
@47237 = ~Anything more? Or have we categorically conquered this cavern's cornucopia of cockamamie creepy-crawlies? ~ [BD47237]
@47238 = ~Beetle's good eats. Try some. ~ [BD47238]
@47239 = ~Dear Cloakshadow, I'm going to be smelling this place forEVER... ~ [BD47239]
@47240 = ~Good. Now we can do what we should have been doing all this time. ~
@47241 = ~When this is all over, I'm sure I'll look back on this all and laugh. ~
@47242 = ~Hah! Insects crushed beneath my heel have rarely been so literal. ~
@47243 = ~W-we should be-be doing other things n-now. ~
@47244 = ~Ho ho! These bugs tried to eat the lion of Luskan, but they didn't like the taste! ~ [BD47244]
@47245 = ~May the Morninglord's radiance engulf you. How may I be of assistance?~
@47246 = ~You're a priest, right? Can you heal me?~
@47247 = ~Do you have any healing potions for sale?~
@47248 = ~I need nothing right now, thank you.~
@47249 = ~I fear not. Everything I had went to tending to our wounded. Try speaking to Frair Tajik. He should be able to help you better than I.~
@47250 = ~Go in peace.~
@47251 = ~You there! Help me move these bodies, please. ~
@47252 = ~Where do you want them?~
@47253 = ~Leave them where they are. Their owners won't complain.~
@47254 = ~I've better things to do with my time than tend to the dead.~
@47255 = ~We need to get them to the altar in the next chamber so I can prepare them for burial.~
@47256 = ~I hope their lives in the next world meet better ends than in this one. Let's get them to the altar.~
@47257 = ~Fine, but I'd better get some serious good-soul points for this.~
@47258 = ~Do it yourself, if you must. I'll not waste my time on the dead.~
@47259 = ~Thank you, thank you.~
@47260 = ~If you'll not help, then stay out of the way. Be off with you.~
@47261 = ~I thank you for your help. Please place the bodies on the altar. I'll handle things from there.~
@47262 = ~You have my thanks. I've exhausted myself bringing all our dead here. A horrible thing to say, but, sadly, all too true.~
@47263 = ~I'm glad I could be of service. These people have earned a peaceful rest.~
@47264 = ~You obviously recognize the effort this sort of transport takes. I'll leave it to you to determine a fitting payment for my work.~
@47265 = ~I'm often called upon to finish tasks the weak cannot.~
@47266 = ~I'm afraid I don't have anything to spare. Our resources have been stretched beyond any reasonable limit as it is. Which makes me hesitant to do this...~
@47267 = ~I must ask one more thing of you. I recognize Kendra here. She's the sister of a guardsman, Tharantis. Could you tell him of her passing?~
@47268 = ~I would be honored to discharge this solemn duty.~
@47269 = ~Forgive me, but wouldn't that be something better done by you?~
@47270 = ~I haven't time to do your duties as well as my own. Take care of it yourself.~
@47271 = ~That's fair enough. Thank you for your help. May the Morninglord light your way.~
@47272 = ~I have more survivors to inform. Too many. It would help a great deal if you could speak to Tharantis. He patrols the courtyard.~
@47273 = ~I would be honored to discharge this solemn duty.~
@47274 = ~Fine. I'll tell him. ~
@47275 = ~It would help you a great deal, no doubt. I fail to see it improving my situation in any tangible way. Do your duty, Dawnbringer, and leave me to mine.~
@47276 = ~Thank you again. May the Morninglord light your way. ~
@47277 = ~Something I can do for you? ~
@47278 = ~Do you have a sister named Kendra?~
@47279 = ~Nothing right now. Carry on.~
@47280 = ~May fortune rise to you.~
@47281 = ~What kind of mess has she gotten herself into this time?~
@47282 = ~I'm sorry to have to tell you this, but Kendra's been killed.~
@47283 = ~The good news is she won't be getting into any further messes. The bad news, well...~
@47284 = ~The kind from which there is no escape.~
@47285 = ~You're saying—Kendra's dead? No, no, you're wrong! It's someone else. Not Kendra—not my little sister...~
@47286 = ~No... Nothing springs to mind. Thanks for asking, though. Much appreciated.~
@47287 = ~I fear you are right, my friend. I have seen her upset, many times. This is what it looks like.~ [BD47287]
@47288 = ~When you danced, you summoned spirits to fight for you. I do something similar with my magic. Are you a shaman as well?~
@47289 = ~Never fear, the Morninglord will guide us to his remains.~
@47290 = ~Isabella and Ikros

I've destroyed the vampire.

With a single swift motion, I impaled the vampire's corpse. All the vitality leached out of it at once, and what was left of the body sagged in upon itself. It will hunt here no more.~
@47291 = ~I'm still investigating the menhirs. I'll return when I know more.~
@47292 = ~I'll be on my way.~
@47293 = ~We all face loss eventually. I'm sorry you've had to face yours.~
@47294 = ~We were going to see this siege through together. I swore... I swore I would protect her. She laughed and said she'd protect ME.~
@47295 = ~I'm very sorry.~
@47296 = ~I know this comes as a shock, but your sister died fighting for what she believed to be right. Honor her memory and do the same.~
@47297 = ~Pull yourself together. You're a fighter, not a milkmaid. ~
@47298 = ~You're right. I... I'll not dishonor my sister's memory. My heart is broken, but my will is strong. The crusade will pay for what they've done this <DAYNIGHTALL>. ~
@47299 = ~Thank you for telling me this. Now I've a favor to ask of you. Kendra wore a gold chain around her neck. May I have it?~
@47300 = ~I helped prepare her body, but I saw no such chain. I'll ask Junia if she found it.~
@47301 = ~A gold chain, you say? Sure, I'll find that. For you. I'll find it for you. It's your sister's, after all. You should have it.~
@47302 = ~If I have time I'll try to find it, but I make no promises.~
@47303 = ~Thank you. Please excuse me now. I need some time alone.~
@47304 = ~I smell goblin. Dead goblin.~
@47305 = ~I smell goblin. Dead goblin. Best kind.~ [BD47305]
@47306 = ~The malicious monster makes itself manifest. You see what I had to put up with? ~ [BD47306]
@47307 = ~Wonder what happened to them. ~ [BD47307]
@47308 = ~Can you find out? They might be able to tell us something useful.~
@47309 = ~Do you really? I can't say I care overmuch.~
@47310 = ~I'm more interested in making sure whatever it was doesn't happen to us.~
@47311 = ~They were killed. What more need we know? Check the bodies, see if they have anything you can use.~
@47312 = ~Call their ghosts? Yeah, all right.~ [BD47312]
@47313 = ~You wouldn't. You're no goblin. These aren't your kind lying dead on the ground.~ [BD47313]
@47314 = ~Do they have any equipment you can use?~
@47315 = ~Can you do that dance thing, get their spirits to reveal themselves?~
@47316 = ~Thank the gods for that.~
@47317 = ~How good of you to notice.~
@47318 = ~Whatever killed these goblins left little of use behind.~ [BD47318]
@47319 = ~Armor's no good. That axe looks all right.~
@47320 = ~Armor's no good. That axe looks all right. Stand back. I'm calling their ghosts. Find out what happened.~ [BD47320]
@47321 = ~Is that a good idea?~
@47322 = ~What can we expect from these spirits when they arrive?~
@47323 = ~They're dead. Leave it alone. We've better things to do.~
@47324 = ~Depends how the spirits feel about being called. They usually don't like it much. Stay back.~ [BD47324]
@47325 = ~I can do nothing. It's usually the easiest thing to do.~ [BD47325]
@47326 = ~Huh? Whuzzis now?~ [BD47326]
@47327 = ~Fouleye? What the hells is happenin', Fouleye?~ [BD47327]
@47328 = ~Yeah, like Fouleye knows what's goin' on...~
@47329 = ~The Puke isn't happy!~
@47330 = ~Shut up, alla yez! We aren't alone.~ [BD47330]
@47331 = ~The Puke says we kill 'em all! ~ [BD47331]
@47332 = ~You're beyond harming us, friend.~
@47333 = ~The what says kill them all?~
@47334 = ~Try it, ghost. I'll kill you a second time, possibly a third.~
@47335 = ~Shut it, Puke, y'great crevasse! I wanna know what's going on.~ [BD47335]
@47336 = ~I'm with you, Gar. I wanna know what's happ'nin' too.~ [BD47336]

@47341 = ~<CHARNAME>, hero of Baldur's Gate.~
@47342 = ~You speak to M'Khiin, goblin.~
@47343 = ~She asked you a question. Answer it.~
@47344 = ~Not me. Let's leave these be and move on.~
@47345 = ~And M'Khiin, daughter of M'harr.~ [BD47345]
@47346 = ~M'Khiin...? M'Khiin Grubdoubler?~ [BD47346]
@47347 = ~The Grubdoubler she-dog? You dare call our ghosts? To even speak to us?~ [BD47347]
@47348 = ~The Puke says Grubdoubler's wormbaby's gotta die!~ [BD47348]
@47349 = ~These goblins seem to know you, M'Khiin.~
@47350 = ~The Puke had better say what killed the Puke, or the Puke won't like what happens to the Puke.~
@47351 = ~Send these wretches away, goblin. I'll not tolerate them any longer.~
@47352 = ~They won't tell us anything useful anyway.~ [BD47352]
@47353 = ~The Puke's not goin' anywhere till he gets his claws 'round yer dung daughter throat!~ [BD47353]
@47354 = ~Yeah, we know'er. We heard the stories. Never believed'm, but here she is, the Grubdoubler's whelp-monster! How could you do what you did? Tell me! How?~ [BD47354]
@47355 = ~You call M'Khiin a monster?~
@47356 = ~Pot, meet kettle. Pleased to meet you, kettle. My, but your complexion is striking in its darkness.~
@47357 = ~What's he talking about, M'Khiin? What did you do?~
@47358 = ~You will answer her questions, goblin. Not the other way around.~
@47359 = ~She's no true goblin, that one. Somethin' wrong with her inside.~ [BD47359]
@47360 = ~They hate me because I left my tribe.~ [BD47360]
@47361 = ~What kinda goblin does that? None, that's what!~ [BD47361]
@47362 = ~Or a most remarkable one.~
@47363 = ~Is this true, M'Khiin? Did you really leave your tribe?~
@47364 = ~Or a most remarkable one. You abandoned your own people, M'Khiin? There is a strength to you even greater than I suspected.~
@47365 = ~I'll not listen to you disparage your obvious better any longer. Send them away, M'Khiin. You shouldn't have to put up with this.~
@47366 = ~Callin' the Puke weak? That makes the Puke bloodmad!~ [BD47366]
@47367 = ~I think lots of things make the Puke mad. Tell us what happened to you. NOW.~ [BD47367]
@47368 = ~We should tell 'er, Gar. I don't like the way she's lookin' at us.~ [BD47368]
@47369 = ~You'd've done the same.~ [BD47369]
@47370 = ~You are an amazing person, M'Khiin. I'm glad you're with me.~
@47371 = ~I don't know if that's true. I don't know if I'd have had the courage.~
@47372 = ~I would've slain them first, actually. But you're right, I would have left. I assumed the drow took you, but no—you're stronger than that, aren't you?~
@47373 = ~Really? Well—good. Now, you four. What happened to you? What killed you?~ [BD47373]
@47374 = ~Everyone thinks goblins are weak. Usually they're right.~ [BD47374]
@47375 = ~Courage...? I—I don't want to talk about this. You four. What happened to you?~ [BD47375]
@47376 = ~Tell'm, Fouleye. Tell 'em how we ended up dead.~ [BD47376]
@47377 = ~I'm not tellin'm anything.~ [BD47377]
@47378 = ~How did we die, anyway? I remember a whole lotta yellin' and then... nothin'.~ [BD47378]
@47379 = ~You wouldn'ta seen much else. Fouleye split yer skull pretty good.~ [BD47379]
@47380 = ~So you killed each other?~
@47381 = ~Ouch. That's gotta hurt.~
@47382 = ~The favorable aspects of a split skull are debatable, at best.~
@47383 = ~I've heard enough from this rabble. Banish them back to whatever hell you dragged them from, M'Khiin.~
@47384 = ~Gar? 'Zat true? Did—did you kill me...?~ [BD47384]
@47385 = ~Aw, naw, D'mak, naw, naw, naw...~ [BD47385]
@47386 = ~The truth. Now.~ [BD47386]
@47387 = ~Well, yeah, awright, I did kinda kill yez. But y'had it comin', y'know, standin' there witcher back t'me 'n everythin...~ [BD47387]
@47388 = ~Incredible. I am stunned. You fought together. You should have been friends.~
@47389 = ~Friends make the best targets, don't they? They never see it coming...~
@47390 = ~You've heard enough, M'Khiin. Send these wretches back from whence they came.~
@47391 = ~The Puke doesn't got friends!~ [BD47391]
@47392 = ~Which is why he killed me 'n Fouleye. Guess we hurt 'im worse'n I thought though, if he's dead too.~ [BD47392]
@47393 = ~The Puke cannot die! The Puke is... IMMORTAL.~
@47394 = ~Yeah, Puke. We can smell yez. Everyone from here t'Waterdeep can smell yeh.~
@47395 = ~We're done now, ghosts. Back where you came from.~ [BD47395]
@47396 = ~No! He's stronger than I am—can't hold him!~ [BD47396]
@47397 = ~FEEL THE PUKE!~ [BD47397]

@47400 = ~You are dead, goblin. Return from whence you came.~
@47401 = ~M'Khiin? I'ts up to you. Do we show mercy, or end them once and for all?~
@47402 = ~I'll show you the same mercy you'd have shown us!~
@47403 = ~Loot! Please, give us loot!~
@47404 = ~There can be no mercy for such as you.~
@47405 = ~We'll go, just—stop hurtin' us. We hurt enough when we were alive. Shouldn't hafta hurt now.~ [BD47405]
@47406 = ~The Puke's gonna take yer mercy and shove it up yer back nostril!~ [BD47406]
@47407 = ~Talk fast. Give us a reason not to destroy you.~ [BD47407]
@47408 = ~We hid stuff not far from here—in bushes northwest of the bridge. No good fer you, but great fer a goblin.~ [BD47408]
@47409 = ~You've certainly no need of it now. I thank you.~
@47410 = ~You've certainly no need of it now. I thank you.~
@47411 = ~We'll keep it in mind. What would you have us do with them, M'Khiin?~
@47412 = ~You may be right. Finish them off, M'Khiin.~
@47413 = ~Yes. YES! Silence, wonderful, amazing, GLORIOUS silence! It worked!~
@47414 = ~Yes. YES! Silence, wonderful, amazing, GLORIOUS silence! It worked! But—something's wrong. Adoy's gone, but—what's happening to me...?~ [BD47414]
@47415 = ~Well. This isn't ideal. But I'll take it over having someone else endlessly babbling in my brain.~ [BD47415]
@47416 = ~Oh, gods... What have I done? ~ [BD47416]
@47417 = ~It's not so bad, Neera. You're going to get through this. I'll make sure of it.~
@47418 = ~You drank a potion you knew was flawed, and now you pay the price.~
@47419 = ~Th-thanks, <CHARNAME>. I don't know what I'd do without you...~ [BD47419]
@47420 = ~Didn't your mother ever tell you that if you can't say anything nice about—~
@47421 = ~Didn't your mother ever tell you that if you can't say anything nice about— No. I guess she wouldn't have, would she? I'm sorry, <CHARNAME>.~ [BD47421]
@47422 = ~It's just—I knew taking the potion was risky, but I never expected... this. I think I—I need to be alone right now.~ [BD47422]
@47423 = ~No. You need to be with friends right now. I won't let you face this alone.~
@47424 = ~I understand. But you don't have to go through this on your own. If you change your mind, head back to the camp. I'll return there myself soon enough.~
@47425 = ~Show some spine, girl. You made a mistake, you pay the price. Don't make ME suffer for it too.~
@47426 = ~I'll do that. Goodbye, <CHARNAME>. For now, anyway.~ [BD47426]
@47427 = ~You always come through for me, don't you? Fine. I'll stay with you. But don't expect me to be happy about it.~ [BD47427]
@47428 = ~<CHARNAME>... I think you should run now.~ [BD47428]
@47429 = ~I don't like the way she's glowing.~ [BD47429]
