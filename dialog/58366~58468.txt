@58366 = ~I am no mercenary. It is my faith that calls me to the Shining Lady's service.~
@58367 = ~I don't have that kind of money.~
@58368 = ~How about 50 gold?~
@58369 = ~So be it. Here's the gold.~
@58370 = ~It's better than an empty pocket. Welcome to the crusade.~
@58371 = ~How about you pay me what I asked or get out of here?~
@58372 = ~I don't have that kind of money.~
@58373 = ~So be it. Here's the gold.~
@58374 = ~How about 50 gold?~
@58375 = ~How about 50 gold?~
@58376 = ~You have a point. I'll be on my way.~
@58377 = ~Too scared to get into a scrap with me? A big man like you shouldn't need reinforcements.~
@58378 = ~Bring it on! I'll kill you all before you can say "mercy"!~
@58379 = ~I don't need any help to whip you!~
@58380 = ~You come from the Shining Lady herself, hey? Where's your uniform?~
@58381 = ~I'm wearing it, dotard. Are you blind?~
@58382 = ~I'm traveling incognito to avoid suspicion.~
@58383 = ~There's a cloth shortage in camp. No one gets uniforms for the time being.~
@58384 = ~I misspoke. I'm actually here to join the crusade. Sign me up!~
@58385 = ~I can see this isn't going to work. Defend yourself!~
@58386 = ~I'll waste no more time with you. Farewell.~
@58387 = ~You bring word from Caelar, you say? You carry her seal?~
@58388 = ~Right here.~
@58389 = ~Stop nattering about seals and let me through. I'll not let your incompetence delay me.~
@58390 = ~Caelar didn't want to risk it falling into enemy hands if I was killed on my mission.~
@58391 = ~I can see this isn't going to work. Defend yourself!~
@58392 = ~I think I've come to the wrong gate. Excuse me.~
@58393 = ~My apologies. Had to be sure you were the real thing.~
@58394 = ~I don't think so. Time for you to be on your way.~
@58395 = ~On your way, then.~
@58396 = ~I can see we're not going to agree on this, so I'll leave you to your duties. Excuse me.~
@58397 = ~Good, that's good. You stay here and get nice and comfy. Someone will come for you... eventually.~
@58398 = ~FLAMING FIST OFFICERS! The Battle for Bridgefort's underway!~
@58399 = ~Bridgefort defenders! To arms! ~
@58400 = ~Belladonna~
@58401 = ~Also known as "deadly nightshade," belladonna is a highly toxic plant and is sometimes used to induce altered states of consciousness.

@58402 = ~Dauston~
@58403 = ~Thanks for the shelter, my Flaming Fist friend! Aside from the urine, the accom—*hic*—accommodations were most agreeable.~
@58404 = ~Get out of here, Dauston! Find a new hole and sleep it off.~
@58405 = ~Ah, hello, hello. And how are you on this fine day—night—whatever it is?~
@58406 = ~Sir Dauston of the Order of the Aster—late of the Order of the Aster—lives to serve. Fare thee well.~
@58407 = ~I said move along, you addled drunkard!~
@58408 = ~Please, officer. The poor fellow's obviously in distress. What's happened to him?~
@58409 = ~Best move along there, sir. You don't want to upset the Flaming Fist. They tend to bellow, and judging by the grayness of your skin and the redness of your eyes, you've enough of a headache as it is.~
@58410 = ~Best do as she says. You don't want to get on the wrong side of the Flaming Fist.~
@58411 = ~Listen to the mercenary, you reeking lackwit. I've no time to waste on the likes of you.~
@58412 = ~By "poor man," you mean once-Lord Dauston, late of the Order of the Aster? Ask him yourself if you really want to know—he delights in the telling the tale.~
@58413 = ~You do me a dis—*hic*—disservice. I take no joy in my story—but I hope it will—will—will deter those tempted to walk the low road of drink, debauchery, and—*hic*—debauchery.~
@58414 = ~Tell me your story, Lord Dauston.~
@58415 = ~There's few things I like better than a good tale of debauchery and debauchery. Let's hear it.~
@58416 = ~I've no time to listen to a fallen knight's tale of woe. Begone.~
@58417 = ~Gods, don't encourage him...~
@58418 = ~Attend my words! Heed me, that you may stay strong where I was weak, stay true where I faltered, stay, stay... Did I mention strong? Hrmph! Anyway. As a paladin in the Order of the Aster, I—*hic*—served a great man. Aun Argent was his name. A more worthy servant Lathander has never had!~
@58419 = ~A worthy soul, then. But if you served under him, how have you come to this?~
@58420 = ~Aun of the Asters? I've heard of this man—he's a legend in some circles, a noble warrior, mighty and true by every account I've heard. But—you say his name is Argent? Is he in some way related to Caelar Argent?~
@58421 = ~Aun Argent, you say? Is he any relation to Caelar Argent?~
@58422 = ~I've no interest in tales of Lathander's puppets. Begone.~
@58423 = ~The tales I could tell you of Caelar, my friend. She was a hellacious child, but her uncle, noble Aun, was patient with her. It cost him everything. It cost ME everything. I—I...~
@58424 = ~Ohhh...~
@58425 = ~He'll be out for days now, see if he isn't. I'd leave him to the vultures, but for all his faults, he's a good enough sort.~
@58426 = ~He seemed to know Caelar Argent. Has he told you anything of her?~
@58427 = ~I'll take your word for it. Before he collapsed, he was talking about Caelar...?~
@58428 = ~You waste your time and Flaming Fist resources in caring for that besotted lackwit.~
@58429 = ~It's my time to waste, and my commander hasn't reprimanded me for helping Dauston yet. Be about your business now, and I'll be about mine.~
@58430 = ~She caused his fall, or so he claims. He's never been very clear on how, exactly. Something to do with his mentor... Now if you'll excuse me, I've a fallen paladin to lug to a cell.~
@58431 = ~Aun Argent was a great man. But great men fall, and none fall farther than those who fall from on high. As my master fell, so did I. How came it to this, you ask? 'Twas all his damnable niece's fault. Caelar Argent...~
@58432 = ~Ho! Do my eyes deceive me? Is this the hero of Baldur's Gate who stands before the home of the Flaming Fist?~
@58433 = ~Please. The Flaming Fist are the real heroes of this city.~
@58434 = ~It's possible your eyes do deceive you—but in the matter of Baldur's Gate, its latest hero, and <PRO_HISHER> position relative to your own, they tell it true.~
@58435 = ~I am <CHARNAME>, it is true. Tell me, what happened to that poor fellow there?~
@58436 = ~Stand aside, mercenary. I've business with one of your prisoners.~
@58437 = ~I can't imagine an esteemed personage like yourself coming here on a whim...~
@58438 = ~Indeed I haven't. I would speak with a man I understand is held in one of your cells. Captain Corwin will vouch for me.~
@58439 = ~I wanted to speak to one of your guests, but before I do, what's that poor fellow's story?~
@58440 = ~I have my own reasons for being here. Stand aside.~
@58441 = ~Why you'd want to speak to one of those weasels is beyond me, but it's your time to waste. Good luck.~
@58442 = ~Aye? I'll leave you to it, then. Farewell. ~
@58443 = ~Anyone else spoke to me like that, they'd enjoy a night in a cell. But for the <PRO_MANWOMAN> who killed Sarevok? I'll let it slide. THIS time.~
@58444 = ~Good <DAYNIGHTALL> to you. How can I be of assistance?~
@58445 = ~There was a drunken man out here earlier. Do you know what became of him?~
@58446 = ~You can go away.~
@58447 = ~Old Dauston? He's in a nice, warm cell, sleeping off the drink. Will be for a while, most like.~
@58448 = ~Thank you. Farewell.~
@58449 = ~A pity. I'd have liked to hear more of his story.~
@58450 = ~What a waste of flesh.~
@58451 = ~Have yourself a fine <DAYNIGHTALL>, <PRO_SIRMAAM>.~
@58452 = ~You're more patient than I am, then. Farewell.~
@58453 = ~It's not my place to judge another. I don't know what it was that brought him low, but judging from his current state, I'd guess he's not had an easy life.~
@58454 = ~Would that I could, but a Flaming Fist officer goes where her commander tells her to. You, however, would be wise to move along, before that same Flaming Fist officer loses her patience.~
@58455 = ~Oh, hey. How's the happenings?~
@58456 = ~Neera. I didn't expect to see you here.~
@58457 = ~The happenings continue to occur, despite my best efforts.~
@58458 = ~What are you doing here, elf?~
@58459 = ~Half-elf. I'm a half-elf.~
@58460 = ~There wasn't a whole lot left for me back at Bridgefort. I heard people who helped out against Caelar got their legal record in Baldur's Gate expunged, which would be handy. I, uh, had a little trouble there once five or six times. A surprisingly flammable city, is Baldur's Gate...~
@58461 = ~I'm glad you've decided to join the effort to thwart Caelar. Perhaps you'd like to accompany me? I could use someone of your power, unpredictable though it is.~
@58462 = ~I hadn't noticed, but I suppose you'd know. Hey, why don't you lose the paladin and join me?~
@58463 = ~Is that so? Tell me more. Seriously, join me. I could use some good company—and some backup, if things get messy.~
@58464 = ~You lack the control your powers require. You should not have come here. You're a danger to us all.~
@58465 = ~Count me in!~
@58466 = ~Count me in—if I have to listen to another of the paladin's sermons I, I, I—I don't know what I'll do. Something regrettable, knowing me. <CHARNAME>, take me away.~
@58467 = ~Yeah, happenings will do that. Occurring's the only thing they do, really.~
@58468 = ~All riiiight... I can see this conversation isn't going to end better later than it would now, so I'll just let you be on your way, shall I? Yes, yes, I shall. Good <DAYNIGHTALL>.~
