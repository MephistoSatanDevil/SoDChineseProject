@45265 = ~This is a disaster!~
@45266 = ~Without ruby wine, no one will stay here. NO ONE.~
@45267 = ~A tavern without ruby wine is like a wizard with no spellbook.~
@45268 = ~The tavern will be ruined! I'll be out of a job!~
@45269 = ~A tavern with no ruby wine is like a paladin without an attitude.~
@45270 = ~We'll be ruined. RUINED! This is the worst redblooding day of my life!~
@45271 = ~Your pardon, my lady. Is there some way I can be of assistance?~
@45272 = ~What's going on?~
@45273 = ~Stop exaggerating and tell me what the problem is.~
@45274 = ~I'm looking for some mint wine. ~
@45275 = ~I don't have time to listen to you.~
@45276 = ~Mint wine? I can't think about mint wine right now. Let me get this disaster sorted out and THEN we can talk about mint wine.~
@45277 = ~Let me get this situation sorted out and THEN I'll talk about mint wine.~
@45278 = ~I almost can't bear to say it out loud, but... Our barrels are empty. We're COMPLETELY SOLD OUT of ruby wine.~
@45279 = ~This is a bad thing?~
@45280 = ~A tragedy indeed. How will you go on?~
@45281 = ~That's all?~
@45282 = ~You don't understand. That wine is our most popular item!~
@45283 = ~That's all? That's all? What do you mean that's all?~
@45284 = ~You've no idea how many ships we're going to see in the harbor in the next tenday. Thirsty sailors will be here demanding ruby wine, and we'll have none to give them!~
@45285 = ~Is there anything I can do?~
@45286 = ~Might as well just quit on the spot and get it over with.~
@45287 = ~What an insignificant problem.~
@45288 = ~Hey, you're the hero of Baldur's Gate, aren't you? <CHARNAME>, I recognize you now. You're friendly with the Council...~
@45289 = ~I have that honor, yes.~
@45290 = ~You look like someone who's had an idea. Please tell me I'm wrong about that. Other peoples' ideas always cause problems.~
@45291 = ~What of it?~
@45292 = ~I happen to know Duke Belt has a personal stash of ruby wine in the Ducal Palace cellar. Do you think you could get me a barrel?~
@45293 = ~You would have me steal from the Ducal Palace?~
@45294 = ~Sure, if the price is right.~
@45295 = ~How do I recognize ruby wine?~
@45296 = ~I am a wizard of some skill. I may be able to turn a barrel of normal wine into ruby wine.~
@45297 = ~As a druid, I understand the nature of such beverages. I might be able to turn regular wine into ruby wine.~
@45298 = ~Ruby drinkers wouldn't know good wine if it poured itself down their throats! Let me show you a REAL drink.~
@45299 = ~I've no interest in this foolishness.~
@45300 = ~Borrow, steal... hells, leave some gold in its place for all I care. I just need that wine!~
@45301 = ~I'll bring you some as soon as I can sneak into the palace cellar.~
@45302 = ~Give me gold enough to buy a barrel of wine to leave in its place, then.~
@45303 = ~What will you give me to do this?~
@45304 = ~I'm not going to steal from a Grand Duke. Certainly not on your behalf.~
@45305 = ~Ooooh, I have a GREAT reward in mind. Yep, it's really something. But first, bring me the wine!~
@45306 = ~Give me gold enough to buy a barrel of wine. I'll leave that in place of what I take.~
@45307 = ~It has a really sharp, spicy smell. Ordinary wine just smells... winey.~
@45308 = ~And you would really have me to steal a barrel from the Ducal Palace?~
@45309 = ~What will you give me if I do this?~
@45310 = ~You can't truly believe I'll rob the Ducal Palace for you.~
@45311 = ~Fine, here's a purse with 50 gold pieces in it. Leave it in place of the barrel.~
@45312 = ~Hurry back as soon as you have the wine!~
@45313 = ~Suit yourself. It's your loss!~
@45314 = ~You think so? All right, then. Here's a barrel of ordinary wine—do what you can.~
@45315 = ~All right, I'll enchant the barrel.~
@45316 = ~I changed my mind. You said you wanted me to steal a barrel of wine?~
@45317 = ~Now to taste it...~
@45318 = ~By the blood of Alathan! That's TERRIBLE! I can't sell this! You HAVE to get me a replacement barrel.~
@45319 = ~Sorry. I'll bring you the wine as soon as I can get into the palace cellar.~
@45320 = ~Zustrin! This is amazing, it's just like ruby wine! Thank you, thank you! Take this helmet, please. It's a small price to pay for saving my job.~
@45321 = ~Glad I could help.~
@45322 = ~A tankard helmet? Well, that's... unique.~
@45323 = ~Try to manage your kitchen with less incompetence from now on.~
@45324 = ~No time to chat! Gotta get back to work!~
@45325 = ~I... feel strange... *hic*~
@45326 = ~What are you talking about? What kind of drink?~
@45327 = ~This is a recipe my people use: Take a barrel of red grape wine and add two handfuls of salt and a pinch of sulfur. Let stand for three minutes before stirring, and make sure you're sitting before drinking. We call it Tongueblister!~
@45328 = ~Never mind, I'd rather not share my recipe. You said you wanted me to steal a barrel of wine?~
@45329 = ~All right, let me give it a try...~
@45330 = ~You're right! This is terrific—MUCH better than ruby wine! Thank you, thank you! Here, take this helmet as a reward.~
@45331 = ~Glad I could help.~
@45332 = ~A tankard helmet? Well, that's... unique.~
@45333 = ~Try to manage your kitchen with less incompetence from now on.~
@45334 = ~You're back! Got that ruby wine for me yet?~
@45335 = ~No, not yet. ~
@45336 = ~How do I recognize ruby wine again?~
@45337 = ~Yes, I have it here. This is definitely ruby wine.~
@45338 = ~Hurry it up, then! ~
@45339 = ~It's got a really sharp, spicy smell. Ordinary wine just smells winey. ~
@45340 = ~I'll bring a barrel back as soon as I can get one from the palace cellar.~
@45341 = ~You got it! I'm saved! I mean, the tavern is saved! ~
@45342 = ~I'm glad I could help. ~
@45343 = ~Now about that reward? ~
@45344 = ~Enough. I only brought the barrel in exchange for payment. ~
@45345 = ~Here, take this helmet as a reward. Magnificent, isn't it?~
@45346 = ~I appreciate it, Irina. ~
@45347 = ~A tankard helmet? That's... unique.~
@45348 = ~Try to manage your kitchen with less incompetence from now on. ~
@45349 = ~No time to chat! Gotta get back to work! ~
@45350 = ~Good to see you again. ~
@45351 = ~Good to see you too, Irina. ~
@45352 = ~I'm looking for some mint wine. ~
@45353 = ~Oh, it's you again. I have to go. ~
@45354 = ~Anything for a friend! Here, on the house. ~ [BD45354]
@45355 = ~Thanks, I appreciate it. ~
@45356 = ~This had better be the real thing. ~
@45357 = ~No time to chat! Gotta get back to work! ~
@45358 = ~Three drops of lemon balm oil... a half-pinch of powdered silver...~
@45359 = ~Greetings. ~
@45360 = ~Are you mixing up a potion? This isn't a laboratory. ~
@45361 = ~What are you muttering about? ~
@45362 = ~Oh, pardon! I thought I was alone here. I'm conducting an experiment, yes. ~
@45363 = ~What sort of experiment? ~
@45364 = ~I hope it's not the kind of experiment that makes taverns burn down. ~
@45365 = ~Tell me what you're up to. ~
@45366 = ~Nothing dangerous, m'dear, nothing dangerous. I'm working out a way to reveal invisible ink! ~
@45367 = ~That explains why you're by this bookshelf. ~
@45368 = ~It COULD be dangerous, if the words you reveal are a curse or an explosive enchantment. ~
@45369 = ~Is that all you're doing? ~
@45370 = ~I suppose it could, yes. But I'm not looking for those kinds of words. I have a sample of invisible ink here I'm testing on. ~
@45371 = ~I'm testing out my potion on these books, yes. I have a sample of invisible ink to write with. ~
@45372 = ~It's not working out though, yes. I need one more ingredient. If I could trouble you, m'dear, could you come back to me if you find any mint wine? ~
@45373 = ~Certainly. I'll keep an eye out for some. ~
@45374 = ~What's mint wine? ~
@45375 = ~If it's mint wine you need for your potion, I can recommend a substitute. Let me look at what you have here... ~
@45376 = ~I'd be happy to turn over a bottle of wine for a purse of gold. ~
@45377 = ~I have no time to help you, old woman. ~
@45378 = ~Well, it's wine, yes, from Cormyr. Tastes all of peppermint. ~
@45379 = ~I'll keep an eye out for some. ~
@45380 = ~If it's mint wine you need for your potion, I can recommend a substitute. Let me look at what you have here... ~
@45381 = ~I'd be happy to turn over a bottle of wine for a purse of gold. ~
@45382 = ~I have no time to help you, old woman. ~
@45383 = ~Yes, I see... crush the anise in with the lemon balm... let me try it out. Give me one moment.~
@45384 = ~Oh, thank you, m'dear. Do come back if you find any. ~
@45385 = ~That's too bad, yes. Do come back if you change your mind. ~
@45386 = ~It worked! You're a genius, m'dear. ~
@45387 = ~I'm curious. What exactly are you going to use this potion for? ~
@45388 = ~It was easy for a wizard of my skill. ~
@45389 = ~Tell me what you're using this potion for. ~
@45390 = ~Found any mint wine yet, m'dear? ~
@45391 = ~No, not yet. ~
@45392 = ~Yes, I have some here. ~
@45393 = ~Do come back if you find any, yes. ~
@45394 = ~That's it! Thank you, now the potion is ready! ~
@45395 = ~I'm curious. What exactly are you going to use this potion for? ~
@45396 = ~It was easy for a hero of my skill. ~
@45397 = ~Tell me what you're using this potion for. ~
@45398 = ~And you are a skilled one, yes. ~
@45399 = ~I might as well tell you, since you've helped me so much. I want to use the potion on a rare tome hidden away in Candlekeep! ~
@45400 = ~Candlekeep? ~
@45401 = ~That's going to be difficult.~
@45402 = ~You must be joking. ~
@45403 = ~I suppose it can do no harm to tell you, you've helped me so much. I want to use the potion on a rare tome hidden away in Candlekeep! ~
@45404 = ~Candlekeep? ~
@45405 = ~That's going to be difficult. ~
@45406 = ~You must be joking. ~
@45407 = ~I know, it won't be easy, m'dear. Do you know much about Candlekeep? ~
@45408 = ~Actually, I was raised there. ~
@45409 = ~Only a little. ~
@45410 = ~Nothing at all. ~
@45411 = ~I realize it sounds silly, m'dear. Do you know much about Candlekeep? ~
@45412 = ~Actually, I was raised there. ~
@45413 = ~Only a little. ~
@45414 = ~Nothing at all. ~
@45415 = ~To enter Candlekeep you have to give over a fancy tome, one the librarians consider of great value. I've been looking for such a book but can't find one.~
@45416 = ~Actually, I was raised in Candlekeep. I remember how few people visited. ~
@45417 = ~Yes, it seems like that would be difficult. ~
@45418 = ~I have to go now. ~
@45419 = ~I know that Candlekeep has an ancient book from the Netherese Empire, yes. I believe there's hidden writing in the book and my potion can reveal it! ~
@45420 = ~I was raised in Candlekeep and I think the monks there would have discovered such hidden writing by now. ~
@45421 = ~How interesting. ~
@45422 = ~I have to go now. ~
@45423 = ~Since I can't find a tome of great value, I'm going to ask that the monks let me in in exchange for my potion. ~
@45424 = ~I was raised in Candlekeep and I've never heard of them letting anyone in without a book. ~
@45425 = ~How did you learn about this Netherese book? ~
@45426 = ~I have to go now. ~
@45427 = ~You might not know it to look at me, m'dear, but I'm a wizard. I've studied long to find out the secret of this book, yes. Now I just need to see it. ~
@45428 = ~I was actually raised in Candlekeep. Maybe I can help you. ~
@45429 = ~Good luck with your quest. ~
@45430 = ~I'm grateful to you for helping me out, m'dear. Take this bit of money. I was saving it to buy the tome of great value, but it's not nearly enough.~
@45431 = ~You were raised in Candlekeep? Tell me more. ~
@45432 = ~I had a quiet childhood, but a peaceful one. I learned a great deal and always felt safe. ~
@45433 = ~The monks were kind to me but in the end Candlekeep wasn't enough to satisfy me. I had to go out on my own and see the world. ~
@45434 = ~It was a boring, tedious place and I always longed to escape it. I'm glad I never have to return there. ~
@45435 = ~And did the monks there raise you? ~
@45436 = ~My mentor, Gorion, raised me. I had other friends and people I considered family, but he was like my father. I mourned when he was murdered. ~
@45437 = ~A man named Gorion did his best to raise me, but he was murdered just as I left Candlekeep. In the end I avenged him. ~
@45438 = ~A man named Gorion tried to raise me. He was murdered shortly after we left Candlekeep and I went on my own way. ~
@45439 = ~You have never been back since? ~
@45440 = ~Once, but it was not a pleasant experience. I made my peace when I was there and haven't been back again. ~
@45441 = ~Only to hunt down my murderous half-brother. It's a long story. ~
@45442 = ~After I left the last time, I vowed never to return to that musty old place. ~
@45443 = ~That's very dramatic, yes. Thank you for telling me your story. I could use your help for certain, m'dear. ~
@45444 = ~I want to enter Candlekeep to view a Netherese tome with hidden writing my potion will reveal. But I haven't a tome of great value to gain entry. ~
@45445 = ~How can I help? ~
@45446 = ~Yeah, the gatekeeper is really determined not to let anyone in without a book. ~
@45447 = ~Get to the point. ~
@45448 = ~I'll explain to them that I can enhance an existing tome by revealing its hidden contents. That's almost like giving them a book, yes? ~
@45449 = ~I'm not sure it will work, but you can try. ~
@45450 = ~The gatekeeper is a real stickler for the rules. ~
@45451 = ~That will never work. ~
@45452 = ~I know it's a long shot, m'dear, but with a letter from you I might stand a better chance! Will you sign this letter explaining my offer? ~
@45453 = ~Certainly. Here you are. ~
@45454 = ~I'm not sure about this. ~
@45455 = ~No, I don't want to sign your letter. ~
@45456 = ~Oh, thank you, m'dear, thank you! I'm going to leave for Candlekeep at once. Here's a little reward for your help. ~
@45457 = ~It's not asking you to swear anything or vouch for me, just explains the situation. Won't you help me out? ~
@45458 = ~Very well. Here you are. ~
@45459 = ~No, I don't want to sign your letter. ~
@45460 = ~I understand. I'm off to Candlekeep at any rate, and we'll see what they say. Here's a little reward for your help with the mint wine. ~
@45461 = ~Barrel of Wine~
