@42314 = ~Hold, Voghiln! They do not wear crusade colors.~
@42315 = ~Oh. Ja, you are right. Who are you, stranger?~
@42316 = ~I am <CHARNAME> of Baldur's Gate, come to fight Caelar's crusade.~
@42317 = ~Jaheira? Is that you?~
@42318 = ~Be you friend or crusader?~
@42319 = ~<CHARNAME>? You're supposed to be in Baldur's Gate. What are you doing here?~
@42320 = ~Marching to Dragonspear to fight against Caelar and her crusade. And you?~
@42321 = ~How did you come to be here without Khalid?~
@42322 = ~I might ask the same question. Who are you?~
@42323 = ~When you put an end to the iron crisis, Khalid and I decided to travel to Bridgefort, thinking it would make for a pleasant respite from Baldur's Gate. And it was—until the crusade took Boareskyr Bridge. I was trapped outside Bridgefort, Khalid within.~
@42324 = ~Join me, Jaheira. Together, we shall liberate Bridgefort and reunite you with your husband.~
@42325 = ~So you and these others stand against the crusade. Doesn't seem like a fair fight.~
@42326 = ~You haven't made an impressive showing here thus far.~
@42327 = ~They are many. We are few. ~
@42328 = ~A thousand ill-trained crusaders are no match for us—and the troops accompanying me. They are camped southwest of here; join them and await my return.~
@42329 = ~You're at least one more now. Join me.~
@42330 = ~I will thin the crusade's ranks. Head southwest to the Flaming Fist camp; I shall meet you there.~
@42331 = ~I promised Gorion I would keep you safe. I gave him my word. This is not a safe place. ~
@42332 = ~Join me, then. Watch over me as best you can. I'll not leave until the crusade has been driven back across Boareskyr.~
@42333 = ~There's no safe place for me, not while Caelar lives. She sent assassins into the Ducal Palace. They nearly killed me and Imoen.~
@42334 = ~Gorion is dead. If Caelar isn't eliminated, I will join him sooner than later. If you believe I'll stand idly by and wait for it to happen, you know nothing of me. Now do as I say and get thee to the camp.~
@42335 = ~This is true. Very well.~
@42336 = ~So the gentle Jaheira will go at this <PRO_MANWOMAN>'s side? And, ah, what shall Voghiln do in the meantime?~
@42337 = ~Forgive me, <CHARNAME>. This is Voghiln of Luskan. A bit too-lusty, but a worthy fighter. We would have been taken by the crusade were it not for him.~
@42338 = ~Come with me, Voghiln. Any friend of Jaheira's is a friend of mine.~
@42339 = ~He and your other followers will find refuge in the camp to the southwest.~
@42340 = ~Join me, Voghiln. A Luskan warrior is a desirable thing to have, in combat.~
@42341 = ~I would not call him friend, but he is useful.~
@42342 = ~I will be more than just a friend to the beautiful Jaheira, ere this is over, ho ho! Now! Let us go beard the lion in its den, ya?~
@42343 = ~As best we can, given our numbers.~
@42344 = ~Before you range too far, you should know, the crusade holds Boareskyr Bridge and you'll not be allowed into Bridgefort, at least not through the front. But there may be another way...~
@42345 = ~This camp you speak of, does it welcome all who would battle the crusade? And can wine be found within it?~ [BD42345]
@42346 = ~Good! We will see you again soon, ja?~ [BD42346]
@42347 = ~I was visiting Bridgefort with my husband, Khalid, when the crusade attacked. He was trapped within, I without. I have spent the weeks since trying to find a way to reunite with Khalid.~
@42348 = ~Join me, Jaheira. Together, we shall liberate Bridgefort and reunite you with Khalid.~
@42349 = ~Reinforcements have arrived. The Flaming Fist are camped just down the path—join them. We can speak when I return.~
@42350 = ~To no avail, I take it?~
@42351 = ~As best we can, given our numbers. They are many. We are few. ~
@42352 = ~I've not come alone, there are more than two score Flaming Fist mercenaries just down the path. Join us, and we will see this siege ended.~
@42353 = ~You're a few more now. Come, show me what there is to see of the Shining Lady's army.~
@42354 = ~They will be fewer still before this is over. There's a Flaming Fist encampment back down the path. Go there and wait for me to return.~
@42355 = ~Very well.~
@42356 = ~Imoen is here?~
@42357 = ~No. She remains in Baldur's Gate, hopefully beyond Caelar's reach.~
@42358 = ~No. She... decided not to take part in this venture.~
@42359 = ~Unfortunately, she is not.~
@42360 = ~Then you need me now more than ever. I shall join you.~
@42361 = ~Ho ho, <PRO_HESHE> asks if we are crusaders! Fighting words, those.~
@42362 = ~We are not looking for trouble—but we are ready to deal with it, if necessary.~
@42363 = ~Nor will I, now or ever.~
@42364 = ~You would have this ragged beast join us? I thought you a man of better taste.~
@42365 = ~You have not seen a looking glass in some time, or you would hold your tongue.~
@42366 = ~No, <CHARNAME>. It is I, Minsc. Do you not remember?~
@42367 = ~I don't think <PRO_HESHE>'s talking to you, big boy.~
@42368 = ~Yes. Show us their butts, that we may proceed with the kicking of them.~
@42369 = ~You mention the Flaming Fist down the path but do not introduce those who stand beside you. Interesting.~
@42370 = ~I will join you, <CHARNAME>, if that is your wish.~
@42371 = ~She'll be safe. The dukes will not allow what happened to repeat itself.~
@42372 = ~You can hardly blame her for that. She had a poison dagger shoved in her side.~
@42373 = ~You need no Imoen. You have me.~
@42374 = ~Jaheira, my love! It's been days since your last message. I was afraid—~
@42375 = ~You are not rid of me so easily as that, Khalid.~
@42376 = ~And you will not ever be rid of me. I swear it.~
@42377 = ~I'll let you have some privacy. There's a Flaming Fist camp not far from here. I'll see you there when I return.~
@42378 = ~Save the welcome for later—come on, we have work to do. ~
@42379 = ~I beg to differ.~
@42380 = ~It has been days since I last saw my husband, <CHARNAME>. I'll not be apart from him again so soon.~
@42381 = ~I understand. You two go get reacquainted. There's a Flaming Fist camp not far from here. I'll see you there when I return.~
@42382 = ~He'll need to come with us, then. Business before pleasure.~
@42383 = ~I've not seen Jaheira for days, <CHARNAME>. You c-cannot mean to break us apart again.~
@42384 = ~Forgive me, Khalid. Of course you and Jaheira should be together now. There's a Flaming Fist camp not far from here. I'll see you there when I return.~
@42385 = ~If you'll depart from Jaheira, then we'll have to bring her along.~
@42386 = ~I care not where I go, so long as I-I-I am with my beloved.~
@42387 = ~Take care of yourself, <CHARNAME>. We'll talk again soon, I'm sure.~
@42388 = ~We'll g-go there now. Farewell.~
@42389 = ~Excellent. Then it is decided.~
@42390 = ~It's over! The Battle of Bridgefort has been won!~
@42391 = ~I'll give credit where it's due. You did well here today, <CHARNAME>. It was a bloody business that would have been bloodier still were it not for you.~ [BD42391]
@42392 = ~It was nicely done, but there's still work to do.~
@42393 = ~I'll have the camp struck. We'll make for Dragonspear as soon as you're ready.~ [BD42393]
@42394 = ~Jaheira, my love! It's been days since your last message. I was afraid—~
@42395 = ~You doubted you would see me again, Khalid? You do not get rid of me so easily as that.~
@42396 = ~And you will not ever be rid of me. I swear it.~
@42397 = ~We owe our reunion to you, <CHARNAME>. Thank you.~
@42398 = ~I'm happy to have brought you and Khalid together again, Jaheira. But Caelar is far from defeated. Would you help me end her crusade?~
@42399 = ~You know my name, but I don't know yours. I'm afraid you have me at a disadvantage.~
@42400 = ~You have nothing to thank me for. I did what I did for myself, not for you.~
@42401 = ~Well, you have our thanks for it. If there's anything we can ever do for you, let us know.~
@42402 = ~I may take you up on that. Go to the Flaming Fist camp down the road. I'll see you there shortly.~
@42403 = ~I'll do that. I don't believe I caught your name...?~
@42404 = ~An unlikely scenario, but I suppose it is possible.~
@42405 = ~We came here seeking answers to the questions surrounding the Shining Lady, and have found few thus far. Of course we shall join you.~
@42406 = ~I am Jaheira, and this is my husband, Khalid. We came here at the bidding of some... friends... to find out what we might about Caelar's crusade. We were separated when Caelar's forces attacked Bridgefort. Surely Gorion told you about us?~
@42407 = ~It gives me joy to know I had a hand in reuniting you. But Caelar remains a threat. Will you help me end her crusade?~
@42408 = ~True love cannot be thwarted. I'll leave you two to get reacquainted.~
@42409 = ~If you've a mind to avenge that disrespect, you may join the Flaming Fist caravan I'm a part of. We will set off to face Caelar herself at Dragonspear Castle in short order, I expect.~
@42410 = ~We will do that. There is m-much the Shining Lady and her crusade must answer for.~
@42411 = ~Corporal Duncan tells me the Flaming Fist goes to Dragonspear to face Caelar. Khalid and I have an interest in the Shining Lady. We will join them in their trek. Thank you again, <CHARNAME>. We are in your debt.~
@42412 = ~Ex-excellent. Should you have n-need of us, you will find us there. Farewell, a-a-and thanks again.~
@42413 = ~Look, all. The champion of Baldur's Gate—nay, the champion of Bridgefort, is here! ~
@42414 = ~Ah, the hero of Baldur's Gate—and the hero of Bridgefort! Share a drink with me!~ [BD42414]
@42415 = ~In time, my friend. For now I'd like you to join me in my travels.~
@42416 = ~Forgive me, my friend, I don't believe I know your name.~
@42417 = ~I know we've met, but I know little about you.~
@42418 = ~I'd put down that flask and be on your guard. ~
@42419 = ~Ah, the hero of Baldur's Gate! Share a drink with me!~ [BD42419]
@42420 = ~In time, my friend. For now I'd like you to join me in my travels.~
@42421 = ~Forgive me, my friend, I don't believe I know your name.~
@42422 = ~I know we've met, but I know little about you.~
@42423 = ~There are other matters I must attend to—as should you. ~
@42424 = ~You have the pleasure of speaking with Mighty Voghiln, slayer of the Nightmare clan, pride of the Ten Towns! ~ [BD42424]
@42425 = ~Well met, Voghiln of the Ten Towns. I seek to vanquish Caelar Argent. Would you join me?~
@42426 = ~Perhaps you would seek to add Dragonspear to your exploits? Caelar and her crusade await.~
@42427 = ~We clearly take pleasure from very different things. I'll leave you to your revelry.~
@42428 = ~Ho ho! You are a scholar, but judging by what remains of the crusade, you are no gentle man.~
@42429 = ~Voghiln loves a good fight, and you seem to have enough of those. Ja! I will join you... once I finish my drink.~ [BD42429]
@42430 = ~To travel with such a beautiful woman would please Voghiln greatly. First, a toast to you, then we shall march against the crusade!~ [BD42430]
@42431 = ~It is your loss. But not for long, for I travel to Dragonspear with the Flaming Fist. We will drink together at the camp, ja? Ja!~ [BD42431]
@42432 = ~Ah! You are a woman after mine own heart. Introductions! You are <CHARNAME>, of course, but who am I? Well, I shall tell you.~
@42433 = ~Farewell, friend.~ [BD42433]
@42434 = ~I know this man, <CHARNAME>, and can tell you that for all his many... MANY faults, he is a good and valiant warrior. I'd introduce you, but he's a skald—he takes such joy in speaking of himself I would not rob him of the chance.~
@42435 = ~Y-y-you say you know this man? How w-well do you know him?~
@42436 = ~Not as well as I'd have liked her to. You are Khalid, ja? Fear not, mine friend—fair Jaheira's honor was a barrier I could not penetrate.~ [BD42436]
@42437 = ~I d-don't find that part-particularly comforting. Who are, are you again?~
@42438 = ~Yes, I heard you! Now shut up, please.~
@42439 = ~SHUT UP.~
@42440 = ~Shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, SHUT UUUUUUP.~
@42441 = ~WHAT? Uh, I mean—hello! Hi!~ [BD36431]
@42442 = ~Wait a second. I know that voice—NO, NOT YOURS, THE NEW ONE—yours.~ [BD42442]
@42443 = ~You don't remember me? <CHARNAME>? I helped you find that wild mage you were looking for...?~
@42444 = ~Do I know you?~
@42445 = ~Should I be flattered? I am <CHARNAME>. And who do I have the pleasure of being recognized by?~
@42446 = ~I don't believe you do. Nor will you start now.~
@42447 = ~Adoy. Don't say his name. I realize you didn't say his name; I said it. I wish I hadn't said it, and you definitely shouldn't say it.~ [BD36440]
@42448 = ~Be quiet! I'm trying to talk to my friend here. Where was I? Oh right. Adoy. He's been haunting me. Can you be haunted by someone who isn't dead? Well, if you can't, he's doing what would be called haunting if he were dead.~ [BD36441]
@42449 = ~Neera. I'm a magician. Be quiet, Adoy! I'm trying to talk here... <CHARNAME>—can you be haunted by someone who isn't dead? I know you can be hunted by someone who isn't a hunter, but...~ [BD36442]
@42450 = ~Well, if you can't, he's doing what would be called haunting if he were dead.~
@42451 = ~Yes, we're talking about you, and you aren't making it easy, so just be quiet. BE QUIET! ...You can't hear him, can you, <CHARNAME>?~ [BD36447]
@42452 = ~No. ~
@42453 = ~Yes, you know me! Neera, remember? ~ [BD36449]
@42454 = ~Neera, I could use your help, if you're willing to join me?~
@42455 = ~Oh, right. The wild mage. I helped you find another you thought could help you...~
@42456 = ~Right, right. You're a wild mage too. We were looking for another you thought could help you.~
@42457 = ~I don't. But come with me anyway; it might help me remember.~
@42458 = ~No. And I don't think I'm about to start.~
@42459 = ~Honestly? That is so, so great! ~
@42460 = ~There is a Flaming Fist camp not far from here. You'll find it a little more comfortable than this cell—but only a little. Wait for me there.~
@42461 = ~I may have need of you in the coming days. Await me at the Flaming Fist camp down the road.~
@42462 = ~I can do that.~
@42463 = ~Yeah, all right.~
@42464 = ~I can do that. Be quiet! I'm trying to talk to <CHARNAME> here. Where was I?~
@42465 = ~I'm not sure. Who are you talking to?~
@42466 = ~You were in Bridgefort, but the battle's over. You are free.~
@42467 = ~Adoy. He's been haunting me. Can you be haunted by someone who isn't dead? Well, if you can't, he's doing what would be called haunting if he were dead.~
@42468 = ~Wow. You've only been here a minute and you're already less pleasant than Adoy, which I didn't think was possible. Don't let it go to your head, Adoy; you're still unbearable too. But at least I can ask this one to go away. YOU—go away.~ [BD42468]
@42469 = ~There is a Flaming Fist camp not far from here. You should find it more comfortable than this cell, if only a little. Wait for me there until I return.~
@42470 = ~I may have need of you in the coming days. Await me at the Flaming Fist camp down the road.~
@42471 = ~I'm trying to get the ingredients for a—hey, I'm trying to TALK here—for a potion that'll SHUT HIM THE HELLS UP. ~ [BD36470]
@42472 = ~What do you need?~
@42473 = ~I'll not add my voice to the ones vying for your attention. There is a Flaming Fist camp not far from here. Perhaps someone there can help you.~
@42474 = ~Yeah, all right. Nowhere to go but up, right? YES, I KNOW, ADOY, IT'S A FIGURE OF SPEECH. SHEESH!~
@42475 = ~Let's see. Dead water from beneath Boareskyr Bridge, got that already. The leg of a seven-legged spider.~ [BD36474]
@42476 = ~I've no idea where you could find one of those.~
@42477 = ~I do have the leg of such a spider. I don't know why I've got it, exactly, but I do. Take it, please. You'll be doing me a favor.~
@42478 = ~I came upon a giant spider nest not far from here. We might be able to find a suitable leg there.~
@42479 = ~Ho ho. Mighty Voghiln might know where you can find such a spider. It's not far from here.~ [BD36478]
@42480 = ~Honestly? That is so, so great!~ [BD36479]
@42481 = ~I also need a feather from a planetar's wing, some belladonna, a potion of perception, and the juice of one turnip.~ [BD36482]
@42482 = ~I have a planetar feather.~
@42483 = ~I've found a potion of perception.~
@42484 = ~I can get you the feather and the potion of perception.~
@42485 = ~I can get the feather and the potion. Come with me and I'll help you find the others too.~
@42486 = ~I have the feather and the potion—they're yours if you need them.~
@42487 = ~I don't have any of those things, but stick with me and we'll find them, I promise.~
@42488 = ~I have none of those things. But I'll keep an eye out for them.~
@42489 = ~Really? All right. I'm with you.~ [BD36490]
@42490 = ~I hope this isn't too forward, but I think I may be in love with you.~ [BD36491]
@42491 = ~Stick with me and we'll find the rest of the ingredients. I promise.~
@42492 = ~Stick with me and we'll find all the ingredients you need. I promise.~
@42493 = ~Come on. We've things to do.~
