@45158 = ~I sense dark power in your blood. The shadow on your soul spreads like an inky stain. You belong here, creature of darkness.~
@45159 = ~I am what I am. I'll make no apologies, least of all to you.~
@45160 = ~That's a bit harsh, isn't it?~
@45161 = ~We both belong here, radiant one. I as a ruler, you as my vassal—or a corpse!~

@45173 = ~Always happy to have a fiend's gratitude.~
@45174 = ~I don't do favors for demons.~
@45175 = ~I shall take my leave of you. There are many plans I have to foil, many preparations to ruin. Take this blade as my gift. Treat it well. A boon from my kind is rare.~ [BD45175]
@45176 = ~Die if you wish. I will enjoy devouring your soul.~ [BD45176]

@45181 = ~Lord Maxwell,

The time has come to take action. Araya agrees with me that we can't risk openly challenging the Grand Dukes of Baldur's Gate. They wield too much influence, and their motives cannot be trusted. I've heard disturbing whispers regarding the killer of Sarevok, whom the dukes are now in league with. How can we trust them to lead our city and reap the profits thereof? Meet us at the Three Old Kegs on the morrow and we'll decide on a plan of action. Elric should also be joining us. Burn this letter.

@45199 = ~This armor was first worn by Olen Argent, Caelar's great-grandfather. Olen Argent's quest to hunt down a cult of Malar led him to the Misty Forest, where he encountered a group of elves living in the woods. At first, the elves were suspicious of Olen and tried to drive him out of the forest, but he spoke so eloquently of his quest that they agreed to help him. The elves tracked the cult to their hiding place within the forest, where Olen eradicated the cultists for their murderous deeds. Thankful to have the evil presence out of their homeland, the elves crafted a fine suit of mail for the paladin.

The ship's bard leaned over the rail and played a rousing ballad of courage. Bolstered, the merfolk overcame and drove off the vicious sahuagin. One of the mermaids swam up to the ship and handed the bard a glittering shed mermaid tail, telling him that any item fashioned from the scales would gain a valuable enchantment. The bard had the tail made into a pair of boots that have been passed on to his descendants, though their flashy nature makes the wearer quite memorable.

Finally, one night Tinny stabbed his mark in a mugging gone wrong and was shocked to see a gem fall out of the victim's wound. Tinny eagerly grabbed the gem, rejoicing in his newfound wealth.

After the attack was over, Montgomer's mates praised his bravery and joked that he should always keep his "cudgel" at his side.

If I wear the Spectacles of Spectacle, I can see extraplanar creatures and "pull" up to three of them into this world.

I obtained a pair of magic spectacles from the eccentric elf Zaviak. He claims I can use them to see spirits and creatures from other planes and "pull" these creatures into our world a finite number of times. I have no idea how many of these extraplanar creatures I'll see on my journey. I must think carefully before drawing one into the Prime Material Plane.~

One of the drinkers in the tavern, an old woman, stood up midway through the performance and snapped, "You think it clever to insult and belittle others? Do so, then, for as long as you live!" The bard found himself unable to remove his now-cursed protective bracers and was forced to spout corny jokes until he could pay a wizard to remove them.
